2023-02-04  Andras Varga

	* test for detecting duplicate keys in NED object literals

2023-01-23  Andras Varga

	(via MAKEFLAGS)

2023-03-30  Andras Varga

	* core: c++-doubletolongconversion.test

	  eventlog-recording-intervals = ..1, 3..5, 7..

	line in the ini file.

2002-02-24  Andras Varga

	* opp_test.pl: To make it easier to create new test cases from
	existing ones, removed %name from test file syntax; now test name
	is derived from the file name. Cleaned up error handling.
	Changed some command-line switches. Introduced {} as synonym for
	@TESTNAME@. Improved reporting.

	* runtest: accepts command-line args

2002-02-14  Ulrich Kaage  <kaage@int.uni-karlsruhe.de>

	* runtest: Create directory work if it doesn't exist.
