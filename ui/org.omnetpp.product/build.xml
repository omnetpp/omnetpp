	This build script creates a build directory containing the plugins
	and features to be built, and then kicks off the PDE build process.
	You could just as easily do this from a shell script or cron job.
	
	Also, the script can be run inside the Eclipse IDE by choosing 
	Run As -> Ant Build from the context menu. It could obviously be
	run outside of the IDE if you have ANT installed on your path.
	
	If you have any questions about this build, feel free to contact me
	at patrick@rcpquickstart.com.

		PDE Build expects that the build directory contains a "plugins" 
		directory and a "features" directory. These directories should contain
		the various plug-ins and features to be built.
		
		It's possible to use the CVS checkout process that is built into 
		PDE Build. This is done with map files and is beyond the scope of 
		this tutorial. 
		
		This tutorial simply copies the projects directly from your workspace
		into the appropriate build directory folders.
