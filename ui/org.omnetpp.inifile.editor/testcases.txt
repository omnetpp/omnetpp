TODO: in the Parameters table, color "apply-default" differently, so that it stands out from the parameters.
     (we must visually indicate that it's not a parameter)



Corner cases to include in testing:
===================================

Missing [General] section
- check Sections & Parameters pages

Section chain problems
- missing base section
- a Config extends a Scenario
- cycle in fallback chain
- General contains extends= line
 ** check Sections & Parameters page with each of the conditions above **

Bogus Scenarios
- ${} iteration in Config sections
- invalid ${} iteration syntax
- redeclaration of ${} variable
- reference to nonexistent ${} variable
- reference to nonexistent variable in the constraint= line
- constraint= line occurs in a Config section

Handling of included files
- content should appear, but should be non-editable

Sections page
- should work when General doesn't exist
- renaming the General section
- renaming a nonexistent General section
- test flipping a Config into a Scenario, and vica versa (also for General!!!)

Parameters page
- should work when General doesn't exist
- drag&drop
- "New" button
- "Remove" button
- editing, content assist, error handling while editing (bogus entries like duplicate key)

Continued lines (backslash syntax)
- check that everything works, including form editor pages
