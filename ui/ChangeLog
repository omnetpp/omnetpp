	* Fixed issue #938, filtering the eventlog in the sequence chart makes it empty.
	Several parts were commented out during the porting of the old implementation
	from C++ to Java. The missing parts were revived and tested manually.

2022-08-17  Andras Varga

	* NED Editor: Fix #896 "NED Visual editor cannot show warning symbol.
	Showing image not found placeholder instead".

2022-06-11  Andras Varga

	* MSG: MsgResources: fix handling of changed msg files.
	  1. take namespace of C++ classes into account
	  2. types deleted from a msg file were not forgotten when file was reloaded

2022-06-16  Andras Varga

    Neddoc fixes and enhancements:

	* Refined support for msg types with namespace. Accepts various forms:
	unqualified, (fully or partially) qualified, explicitly fully qualified
	(starting with "::"). Links now have a tooltip which shows the fully
	qualified name of the type unless the link label is exactly the same string.

	* Added support for the `@debug links` page directive. When a page or comment
	contains `@debug links`, NED/MSG types will be hyperlinked in a way that
	also shows the original code. E.g. "~inet::Foo" in the page will not simply
	be rendered as a link with the text "Foo", but like this: "[~inet::Foo ->
	Foo]" (where the last "Foo" is the link). This is useful for the test in
	test/misc/neddoc.

	* Make namespaces appear in the navigation tree. Added a "Namespaces" node
	to the navigation tree with namespaces as children, and a namespaces.html
	page that lists classes grouped by namespace.

	* Added rudimentary namespace support to msg documentation
	  1. Include namespace in names of doc pages generated from msg types
	  2. Display namespace on doc pages generated from msg pages

2022-05-24  Attila Torok

	* Analysis Tool: Added the `python/` folders of the [referenced] project[s]
	to the `PYTHONPATH` of chart scripts.

2022-03-18  Andras Varga

	* NED editor: fix #634. Eliminated NED file launcher class (which opened
	either a NED editor or a plain text editor, depending on whether the NED
	file is part of a NED folder or not), and instead make the normal NED editor
	capable of handling files outside NED folders. This makes clicking in the
	Search Results view work as advertised.

2022-08-11  Rudolf Hornig

	* New builder image with updated MINGW toolchain 220810

	* Upgrade to CDT 10.6.2

2022-07-29  Rudolf Hornig

	* Fix #932: Use our own BigDecimal in Sequence Chart. It caused an exception
	when the Filter button was clicked in the Sequence Chart editor.

2022-06-09  Levente Meszaros

	* SequenceChart: Added guard condition for the case when there is no next
	component method entry.

2022-04-11  ------ omnetpp-6.0 released ------

2022-04-07  Attila Torok

	* Analysis Tool: Add Ctrl+Alt+W as shortcut to close a chart page

2022-04-06  Attila Torok

	* Analysis Tool: Wait for Python to connect for 5 seconds instead of 2.5.
	This should reduce timeouts ("Could not get entry point ..." errors) on
	slower machines.

2022-03-29  Attila Torok

	* Analysis Tool: Native vector plots: Make sure that constant vector data
	is not stuck to the chart edge.

2022-03-29  Attila Torok

	* Analysis Tool: Make LinearTicks iterator inclusive on both ends.
	The most important effect is that on purely negative values, the 0 tick
	is now shown on the top/right.

2022-03-29  Rudolf Hornig

	* IDE: a temporary fix for https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=578221

	This bug happens because the embedded Eclipse Java compiler in the
	org.apache.jasper.glassfish package is way too old (from 2015) and cannot
	handle the java.lang.System class file coming from the class path of the
	JDK17 JRE. Adding the org.eclipse.jdt.core package brings an up to date
	Java compiler (for JSP files) that is picked up automatically by the
	org.apache.jasper.glassfish package.

	Once the internal jasper compile is updated, we can remove this dependency.

2022-03-24  Attila Torok

	* Analysis Tool: LegacyAnalysisLoader: Handle Add/Discard ops without
	filter as "all". This is how it worked in 5.7, and this prevents a NPE in
	samples/tictoc/Tictoc18.anf

2022-03-23  Levente Meszaros

	* Sequence Chart: Use an improved version of java.math.BigDecimal instead
	of a Java-wrapped home-grown C++ BigDecimal. We subclass Java's BigDecimal
	in order to override its default brain-damaged equals() method, to return
	true for all representations of the same number.

2022-03-18  Rudolf Hornig

	* Updated the WHATSNEW file in the IDE

2022-03-11  Andras Varga

	* Analysis Tool: fix "Widget already disposed" ex when closing an editor
	with temp charts open.

2022-01-19  Attila Torok

	* Analysis Tool: Fix: Restore error marker functionality in the chart
	script editor.

2022-01-17  Attila Torok

	* Analysis Tool: Ask whether to keep temporary charts upon editor close,
	and only then.

2022-01-14  Attila Torok

	* Analysis Tool: Fix the "All" option (minor lines) for grid in ideplot.

2022-01-11  Rudolf Hornig

	* Documentation Generator: changed the XML format in which extra content
	for the generated NED documentation can be provided.

2022-01-10  Attila Torok

	* Analysis Tool: Use an authentication token for the Py4J connections,
	and explicit loopback addresses everywhere.

2022-01-05  Rudolf Hornig

	* CDT Integration: Added support for URL where the IDE (CDT) can be
	instructed to attach to a process and start debugging. The URL:

	omnetpp://cdt/debuger/attach?pid=<pid>

	The URL can be submitted by running the following command:

	omnetpp omnetpp://cdt/debugger/attach?pid=<pid>

	Qtenv now uses the above command on all platforms to invoke the debugger.

2021-12-21  Attila Torok

	* Remove the Histograms page from boxwhiskers chart template dialog pages.

2021-12-15  Attila Torok

	* Analysis Tool: Overhaul the barchart, scatterchart, and boxwhiskers
	template scripts.

	- Instead of taking `variable_name` as parameter, integrate and delete
	  `get_names_for_title` to make it internally.
	- Don't try to plot all-NaN error bars, return 0 as error for multiple
	  identical values.
	- barchart: Fix the warning about dropping invalid columns in .agg()
	- Factor scatterchart_itervars chart template script apart into a few
	  functions, in utils.py
	- Extract plot_boxwhiskers() to utils.py

2021-12-08  Attila Torok

	* Analysis Tool: Improve the barchart template considerably:
	  - Legend labels made are customizable
	  - Axis and plot titles are more reasonable
	  - Baseline property fixed

2021-12-08  Attila Torok

	* Analysis Tool: Fix title generation in the 3dchart_itervars template

2021-12-11  Andras Varga

	* Analysis Tool: chart templates: added missing "include_fields" checkboxes

2021-12-11  Andras Varga

	* Analysis Tool: Changed how IDs are generated for charts, in order to fix
	occasional ID collisions.

2021-12-10  Attila Torok

	* Analysis Tool: Fix chart.is_native_chart() operation from within the IDE.

2021-12-07  Andras Varga

	* Analysis Tool: fix Export Image NPE for temporary charts

2021-12-07  Attila Torok

	* Analysis Tool: Improvements in utils.extract_label_columns(),
	make_legend_label() and make_chart_title().

2021-12-06  Attila Torok

	* Analysis Tool: Improve the "scatterchart_itervars" chart template script:
	ignore "datetimef", "iterationvarsd", etc run attributes, to avoid
	nonsensical "points are averaged from ... unique ... values" notes.

2021-12-06  Attila Torok

	* Analysis Tool: Fix warnings from Matplotlib when computing confidence
	intervals (for bar- and scatterplots)

2021-11-26  Attila Torok

	* Analysis Tool: Add initial linechart_separate_mpl template

2021-12-06  Andras Varga

	* Inifile Editor: Demote "Unused entry (does not match any parameters)" message
	from WARNING to INFO, and added "maybe" to the wording.

	Reason: There were a lot of false positives, because the analyzer only understands
	"*" as module index in module path patterns, and gets confused if numbers
	or ranges were there, e.g. "**.app[2].pklen". With this change, those false
	warnings are a lot milder.

2021-11-30  Andras Varga

	* Inifile Editor: Allow config option values to contain expressions (i.e. do
	not falsely flag them as errors).

2021-12-04  Andras Varga

	* Analysis Tool: Reset Chart to Template: Allow multi-selection.

2021-12-03  Andras Varga

	* Analysis Tool: linechart fix: with samples/fifo, only "name" was displayed
	in legend, despite configname being necessary to distinguish them

2021-12-03  Andras Varga

	* Analysis Tool: automatic legend: added "prefer module display path to module
	path" option; dialog and code refactoring

2021-11-29  Andras Varga

	* Analysis Tool: legend.xswt: fix wording

2021-11-30  Attila Torok

	* Analysis Tool: Introduce ChartScriptError, raise it from chart scripts
	where needed instead of manually setting the plot warning text and calling
	(an alias to) sys.exit(1).

2021-12-02  Attila Torok

	* Analysis Tool: Add debug assertion to ResultSelectionFilterGenerator

2021-12-01  Attila Torok

	* Analysis Tool: Make sure a DataPanel view filter with an OR operator doesn't
	break selection filter generation

2021-11-30  Attila Torok

	* Analysis Tool: Fix mismatch between "show fields" toolbar button and table
	contents.

2021-11-29  Attila Torok

	* Analysis Tool: Add include_fields chart property to templates.

2021-11-25  Rudolf Hornig

	* IDE: update environment resolvers to provide correct tool directory names
	on Windows

2021-11-18  Rudolf Hornig

	* IDE: Dependencies updated: Eclipse 4.22, JRE 17.0.1, PyDev 9.2;
	Added macos/aarch64 environment for Eclipse.

2021-11-26  Attila Torok

	* Analysis Tool: Patch the included Py4J JAR to make it work with Java 17

2021-11-12  Attila Torok

	* Documentation Generator: Avoid a deadlock when generating NED documentation

2021-11-28  Andras Varga

	* Analysis Tool: Added content assist for column names in the legend format
	string.

	How it works: when the chart script runs, the legend function looks at
	the DataFrame and lets the IDE know the column names by calling
	chart.set_observed_column_names(). When the user opens the chart config
	dialog, content assistance uses this info to provide suggestions.

2021-11-27  Andras Varga

	* Analysis Tool: Added Legend pages to chart templates that support it.
	Others e.g. bar chart bypass the make_legend_label() functions.

2021-11-28  Andras Varga

	* Analysis Tool: Add support for x:id.enablerButton attribute in XSWT files

	If control is something (e.g. a Text) that should be enabled
	conditionally (e.g. when a radiobutton or checkbox is selected),
	specify the ID of the controlling button in the x:id.enablerButton
	attribute of the control.

	Also fix: for x:id.isEnabler=true, if the button is a radio button, it
	should not disable its sibling radio buttons.

2021-11-19  Andras Varga

	* Analysis Tool: Fix Outline selection behavior. When selecting a
	chart in a folder in the Outline view, Charts page could not show
	the chart because it did not switch to the chart's folder.

2021-11-18  Andras Varga

	* Analysis Tool: ExportChartsDialog: improve initial selection.
	Distinguish "nothing is selected" from "selected folder(s) contain no
	chart"

2021-11-18  Andras Varga

	* Analysis Tool: BrowseDataPage: added saveState()/restoreState()

2021-11-18  Andras Varga

	* Analysis Tool: Improved state saving.

2021-11-17  Andras Varga

	* Analysis Tool: assert item IDs are unique

2021-11-13  Andras Varga

	* Analysis Tool: Added the possibility to organize charts into folders
	in Analyses. Note: anf files with folders are not understood by previous
	versions.

2021-11-15  Rudolf Hornig

	* IDE: Updated Eclipse update URLs for Eclipse 4.21 and CDT 10.4.

2021-11-10  Attila Torok

	* Analysis Tool: Remove more label backgrounds

2021-11-11  Andras Varga

	* Analysis Tool: NativeChartViewer: avoid "widget already disposed" error

2021-11-11  Andras Varga

	* Analysis Tool: AnalysisLoader: simplify code; avoid NPE when "value" attr
	doesn't exist

2021-11-10  Andras Varga

	* Analysis Tool: minor fix in chart template loading

2021-11-10  Attila Torok

	* Analysis Tool: Don't paint FormEditorPage label background

2021-11-09  Attila Torok

	* Analysis Tool: Don't run stale scripts when exporting opened charts

2021-11-05  Attila Torok

	* Analysis Tool: Call System.gc() after ShmSendBufferManager::garbageCollect()
	if it did something

2021-11-05  Attila Torok

	* Analysis Tool: Add optional ShmSendBuffer instance number tracking and debug
	output

2021-11-05  Attila Torok

	* Analysis Tool: Always use ShmSendBuffer through std::shared_ptr instead of
	raw pointers.

	This fixes #900 by guaranteeing that there are no double-deletes even if
	an exception is thrown. This makes `owner` and `deleted()` unnecessary.

2021-11-11  Attila Torok

	* Native Libraries: Introduce ShmSendBufferPtr and ShmSendBufferPtrVector
	type definitions for brevity.

2021-11-10  Attila Torok

	* Analysis Tool: Don't set label backgrounds explicitly, they looked bad
	with certain themes.

2021-11-09  Attila Torok

	* Analysis Tool: Don't use stale scripts when exporting opened charts.

2021-11-09  Attila Torok

	* Analysis Tool: Extract ScaveEditor.getScriptsOfOpenCharts() from doSave().

2021-11-08  Attila Torok

	* Analysis Tool: Tiny consistency fix in ShmSendBuffer doc comment.

2021-11-05  Attila Torok

	* Analysis Tool: Call System.gc() after ShmSendBufferManager::garbageCollect()
	if it did something, to make sure the unneeded ShmSendBuffers are freed.

2021-11-05  Attila Torok

	* Analysis Tool: Add optional ShmSendBuffer instance number tracking
	and additional debug output.

2021-11-05  Attila Torok

	* Analysis Tool: Rename ShmPickler::get() to getBuffer() to avoid confusion
	with std::shared_ptr<*>::get().

2021-11-05  Attila Torok

	* Analysis Tool: Fix #900 - Always use ShmSendBuffer through std::shared_ptr
	instead of raw pointers, drop the ShmCleaner helper class.

	This guarantees that there are no double-deletes even if an exception is
	thrown. Also makes `owner` and the `deleted()` callback unnecessary.

2021-10-29  Attila Torok

	* Analysis Tool: Fix #902 (Invalid thread access when using Implement Method
	refactoring).

2021-06-23  Attila Torok

	* Analysis Tool: fix: "Zoom to Fit" action did not ignore disabled
	series after the chart was refreshed.

2021-10-27  Attila Torok

	* Analysis Tool: fix: Compute native plot data margins symmetrically

2021-10-27  Attila Torok

	* Analysis Tool: fix: Reset properties to their defaults after they are
	cleared from the config dialog.

2021-10-27  Attila Torok

	* Analysis Tool: fix: Don't always reset the view area of native charts
	after legend item enablement change

2021-10-28  Andras Varga

	* NED/ini editor: NED's "object" parameter type can now store all other
	types too, so do not flag such assignments as errors.

2021-10-15  Attila Torok

	* Analysis Tool: On the Browse Data page, mask values that don't fit into
	their columns using '####'. This is akin to what MS Excel does.

2021-10-13  Attila Torok

	* Analysis Tool: fix: Pasting into the combo boxes on the Browse Data page
	didn't work.

2021-10-12  Attila Torok

	* Analysis Tool: Improve focus handling on tab switching in the Chart
	Properties dialog.

2021-10-11  Attila Torok

	* Analysis Tool: Fix the bug where middle-click closing a chart tab would
	discard changes silently.

2021-10-11  Attila Torok

	* Analysis Tool: When setting the name of a chart, also set its title, if it
	was empty before.

2021-10-11  Attila Torok

	* Analysis Toolscave/charttemplates: Tweak chart template scores so that the
	editor prefers native plotting to Matplotlib. Native plots are both more
	scalable and also arguably more convenient to use.

2021-10-11  Attila Torok

	* Analysis Tool: When running chart scripts, override exit() to be
	sys.exit(). Being able to use exit() is a matter of convenience and brevity,
	but we want the behavior of sys.exit() -- raising a SystemExit, and nothing
	more.

2021-10-05 Attila Torok

	* Analysis Tool: Follow recent changes in the Python API (plot -> ideplot, etc.)

2021-09-27  Rudolf Hornig

	* Productizing: Updated dependencies to Eclipse 4.21, Pydev 9.0.1

2021-09-21  Attila Torok

	*  Analysis Tool: Avoid using the phrase "iso lines" in scatter plots
	[per suggestion of Edwards Longman]

2021-09-21  Attila Torok

	* Analysis Tool: Don't ignore the title set by the user on 3D and box-whiskers
	charts

2021-07-12  Rudolf Hornig

	* Productizing: Added linux.aarch64 IDE native library support for
	ARM-based Linux distros

2021-07-12  Rudolf Hornig

	* Productizing: justj: Use stripped version of JDK 15 instead of JDK 11

2021-07-07  Rudolf Hornig

	* Documentation Generator: Fix: A missing or closed referenced project caused
	documentation generation to fail.

2021-07-02  Rudolf Hornig

	* Documentation Generator: Made the navigation drawer resizeable and its
	scrollbar bigger in the generated NED documentation.

2021-06-25  Rudolf Hornig

	* Updated to use CDT 10.3 and the latest final version of Eclipse 4.20

2021-06-23  Attila Torok

	* Analysis Tool: Fix result tables not refreshing on file changes (keeping
	stale IDs), by passing a NullProgressMonitor instead of null to Runnable.run().
	This fixes a NPE in BrowseDataPage.doRefreshPage, which caused the tables in
	it to keep stale result IDs in their IDLists, causing further errors
	while plotting, and sometimes blank table rows.

2021-06-10  Attila Torok

	* Analysis Tool: Preserve legend item enablement state on refresh (to some
	degree)

2021-06-21  Attila Torok

	* Analysis Tool: Disable sorting chart templates in context menu by last usage
	timestamp

2021-06-21  Attila Torok

	* Analysis Tool: Relayout native plots on view and zoom property changes,
	so axis tick labels don't get cut off when their number of digits changes

2021-06-10  Attila Torok

	* Analysis Tool: Add digit grouping to tick labels of native chart axes

2021-06-14  Levente Meszaros

	* SequenceChart: Added an optional module parameter to the defaultStatistic
	property.

2021-05-27  Rudolf Hornig

	* Eclipse and private JRE update

	- update to Eclipse 4.20 and pydev 8.3
	- added justj repo and justj feature to the product definition
	- JRE is no longer added manually to the distro. It's coming from justj.
	- special VM options are no longer needed on macOS

2021-05-27  Rudolf Hornig

	* Prod: update to Tycho 2.3

2021-06-01  Rudolf Hornig

	* C++ Build: no longer use the OMNETPP_ROOT *environment* variable in the
	generated Makefiles.

2021-05-31  Rudolf Hornig

	* NED Documentation Generator: fixed wrong file name (double extension)
	and page title when using @page directive

2021-05-12  Attila Torok

	* Inifile Editor: Added support for cmdenv-fake-gui-seed config option

2021-04-29  Andras Varga

	* Inifile Editor: detect duplicate sections in file

2021-04-29  Andras Varga

	* Inifile Editor: Change "Missing section heading" from error to warning.

	Reason: Simulation kernel (envir/inifilereader) has always accepted it,
	and also, many test/core tests exploit it.

2021-04-26  Andras Varga

	* Inifile Editor: FieldEditor: fix background color

2021-04-23  Andras Varga

	* NED Source Editor: fix syntax highlight of string constants containing "//"

	After "//", the rest of the string (and till the end of the line) was
	colored as comment.

2021-04-22  Andras Varga

	* Inifile Editor: fix syntax highlight bug: '#' inside string constants also
	triggered the comment rule

2021-04-22  Andras Varga

	* Inifile Editor: fix syntax highlight of string constants broken onto
	multiple lines using backslash continuation. The coloring of the 2nd line
	was flaky, i.e. colors were lost after editing that line.

	Example:

	 "hello\
	world"  <---- coloring lost after editing this line

2021-04-22  Andras Varga

	* Inifile Editor: fix syntax highlight of backslash-continued comment lines

	The continuation line was not colored as part of the comment.

	Example:

	 # some comment \
	    continued on this line <---- text in this line was not grayed out

2021-04-22  Andras Varga

	* Inifile Editor: Added syntax highlight for section headings

2021-04-20  Andras Varga

	* Inifile Editor: Line parsing adapted for multi-line entries.

	Main issue is how to handle value+comment separation with multi-line
	values. There doesn't seem to be meaningful to edit the "pure" value and
	the comments separately, because the comments may contain commented-out
	lines, comments specific to some part of the value etc, which may become
	misaligned when editing separately.

	The only feasible solution for multi-line values is to leave the comments
	as part of the value, and let the user them as one string. (For
	consistency, the 'comment' part of the entry is then set to "".)

	For validation etc, the net value is needed (ie stripped of comments).

2021-04-19  Andras Varga

	* Inifile Editor: Added support for indented continuation lines.

	In the inifile, if a line is indented, it is taken as a continuation of
	the previous line. You may not break a line inside a string constant that
	way.

	The trailing-backslash way still works (and can also be used to break
	string constants).

2021-04-19  Andras Varga

	* Inifile Editor: The "Config " prefix in section headers is now optional.

	That is, [Config PureAlohaExperiment] may now be also written as
	[PureAlohaExperiment], the two are equivalent.

2021-04-28  Attila Torok

	* Analysis Tool: Handle errors in @vector_operation better

2021-03-25  Attila Torok

	* Analysis Tool: Wire in the vector operation list into content assist

2021-04-20  Attila Torok

	* Analysis Tool: Wire in the vector operation list into the context menu

2021-04-20  Attila Torok

	* Analysis Tool: Register vector operations in Python using a decorator

2021-04-20  Attila Torok

	* Analysis Tool: Fix evaluate() in PythonEntryPoint.py

2021-03-22  Attila Torok

	* Analysis Tool: Add chart templates to plot histograms computed from vector
	results

2021-03-22  Attila Torok

	* Analysis Tool: Copy-paste fix in histogram chart template script.

2021-04-23  Rudolf Hornig

	* IDE: Fix null reference crashes on Windows because of non-existent
	default display during class initialization.

2021-04-23  Rudolf Hornig

	* IDE: Do not force the classic theme in IDE. Let Eclipse decide the theme
	automatically.

2021-04-19  Andras Varga

	* Inifile Editor: fix "widget already disposed" exception

2021-04-19  Andras Varga

	* Inifile Editor: Form editor: more concise display of section names in tables

	Show just "PureAloha" instead of "[Config PureAloha]", there's no chance
	of misunderstanding.

2021-04-18  Andras Varga

	* Inifile Editor: Auto-hide Reset and Expand buttons when mouse is outside the
	field editor

2021-04-17  Andras Varga

	* Inifile Editor: Display notes in smaller font

2021-04-16  Andras Varga

	* Inifile Editor: Form-based editor: align controls by converting to
	2-column grid layout.

2021-04-18  Andras Varga

	* Analysis Tool: fix ClassCastException in editor contributor.
	Got "InifileEditor cannot be cast to ScaveEditor" after an InifileEditor
	was closed and next editor was a ScaveEditor.

2021-04-16  Rudolf Hornig

	* IDE: Dark theme fixes for event log and sequence chart.

2021-04-15  Rudolf Hornig

	* IDE: Added support for dark themes in MSG, NED and INI file editors.

2021-04-15  Rudolf Hornig

	* IDE: Updated syntax-highlight rules for NED, MSG and INI editors

	- added missing NED functions
	- removed obsolete keywords (xmldoc, readonly, noncobject)
	- added new keywords: import
	- added simtime_t as a highlighted type in MSG files as it is very common
	- highlighting of bool constants and NED expression keywords in INI files
	 are now consistent with NED and MSG files

	representing the eventlog using pure Java objects without native calls.

2021-03-29  Attila Torok

	* NED Editor: Fix: Use a custom cursor for the creation tool of the Palette.

	Because of a whole stack of bugs and workarounds in SWT and GEF about a

2021-03-18  Attila Torok

	* Analysis Tool: ScaveEditor: Make sure the 3 built-in tabs are hidden last
	(except for the currently selected one)

	So the Inputs, Browse Data, and Charts pages remain visible for as long
	as possible when resizing the editor to a smaller width.

2021-03-16  Attila Torok

	* Analysis Tool: Charts page: Different icon sizes and margin/spacing in
	different view modes

2021-03-18  Attila Torok

	* Analysis Tool: ScaveEditor: Don't allow closing the 3 built-in tabs with
	middle click

2021-03-18  Attila Torok

	in content assist

2021-02-27  Andras Varga

	* Analysis Tool: barchart, scatter chart: commenting, minor refactor

	- replace lambda with named function to get proper column name in the
	  dataframe
	- apparently utils.confidence_interval() works for empty and 1-element
	 arrays too (and returns nan), no need check for that case here

2021-02-24  Attila Torok

	Analysis Tool: charttemplates: Do not check for chart.is_native_chart() in
	scatterchart_itervars.

	Instead, either don't check at all, or check for plot.is_native_plot()

2021-02-24  Attila Torok

	* Analysis Tool: charttemplates: Proper error message when columns selected
	for pivoting overlap.

2021-02-23  Attila Torok

	* Analysis Tool: added PythonNature to org.omnetpp.scave.templates

2021-02-11  Andras Varga

	* Analysis Tool: plot.py: remove non Pyplot-like APIs

	Reasons:
	- they are not implemented in impl_charttool/plot.py, so charts using
	  them cannot be exported
	- they are currently unused from both utils and the chart scripts
	- MAIN REASON: We want to take plot.py towards being a subset of the
	  PyPlot API. Easier for users, less docu writing, less lamenting about
	  API semantics, etc.

2021-02-11  Andras Varga

	* Analysis Tool: remove *italic* from type annotations in docstrings, as they
	are now inserted by the script

2021-02-09  Attila Torok

	* Analysis Tool: Also query run attributes for histograms in the template

2021-02-09  Andras Varga

	* Analysis Tool: utils.py: customized_box_plot(): swapped two args.
	'labels' arg is practically more important than 'axes', bring it forward.

2021-02-06  Andras Varga

	* Analysis Tool: utils.py: added documentation

2021-02-06  Andras Varga

	* Analysis Tool: swtplot.py: added docs (copypasta from plot.py)

2021-02-09  Attila Torok

	* Analysis Tool: Be consistent with native plot key and label stringification

	This fixes the issue where all bars were the same color on native
	barcharts, while not feeding the unknown "key" parameter to matplotlib.

2021-02-08  Attila Torok

	* Analysis Tool: Fix bar chart template tests

2021-02-08  Attila Torok

	* Analysis Tool: Fix indexing in barchart test

2021-02-08  Attila Torok

	widgets into swtplot.py

2021-02-02  Attila Torok

	* Analysis Tool: Don't ignore the title set by the user on scattercharts

2021-02-02  Attila Torok

	* Analysis Tool: fix: Convert key and title to str in plot.plot_bars

2021-02-03  Attila Torok

	* Analysis Tool: fix: Legend always displayed a line even if series in
	the plot didn't have one.

	Solution: Don't always draw a line under the marker symbols in the
	legend.

2021-02-03  Attila Torok

	* Analysis Tool: fix: Triangle/Tri symbols on the legend didn't reflect
	symbols' orientation on the plot

	Solution: Marker symbols with different orientations are made subclasses.
	This ensures that the class name alone, which is used as a key to the
	image cache, describes the shape.

	This makes sure they will have a different image cache key when they are
	drawn into the legend tooltip, so the first orientation doesn't get
	"stuck" in there.

2021-02-03  Attila Torok

	* Analysis Tool: fix: after calling setSizeHint() on a symbol, its original
	orientation was lost

	Make sure that line marker symbols are oriented correctly, even after
	resizing Which happens when they are about to be drawn on the legend for
	example.

2021-02-03  Andras Varga

	* Analysis Tool: Offer hint to the novice user when vector operation is added.

2021-02-02  Andras Varga

	scripts.

2020-12-11  Attila Torok

	* Analysis Tool: Improve scatterchart template script.

2021-01-14  Andras Varga

	* Analysis Tool: Edit Chart Pages dialog: use one StyledText widget per page.
	Reason: eliminate editing anomalies and confusion due to having a shared undo
	stack for all pages.

2021-01-13  Andras Varga

	* Analysis Tool: Reset Chart To Template: added dialog to choose which
	elements to reset.

2021-01-12  Andras Varga

	* XSWT: store source line/column on the widget. This may be useful later.

	* Analysis Tool: Split the charttemplates folder into its own plugin project.

2021-01-11  Andras Varga

	* Analysis Tool: ChartEditForm: validatePropertyNames: use actual
	properties not the template's property list. Because if chart pages
	are edited, the property list in the template may quickly become irrelevant.

2021-01-10  Andras Varga

	* Analysis Tool: added "Edit Chart Dialog Pages" dialog

2021-01-07  Andras Varga

	* Analysis Tool: new icons for the Edit Chart Dialog Pages dialog

2021-01-04  Andras Varga

	cell editor is open.

2020-12-22  Andras Varga

	* Inifile Editor: Fix watching for changes in included inifiles.

2020-12-20  Andras Varga

	* Inifile Editor: get rid of asynchronous/delayed form page reread in
	FormPage.

	Problem: if user continued typing after committing a field editor,
	delayed re-read tended to overwrite the new changes.

	Solution: As INI re-parsing is fast/cheap (it's the analysis that's
	costly), do it synchronously. Get rid of the async job.

	Inifile analysis still completes asynchronously, we now handle that
	separately, in the analysisCompleted() method.

2020-12-18  Andras Varga

	* Inifile Editor: Revert "ide: ini editor fix: edits lost when typing too
	quickly after hitting Enter"

	Reason: it made the "Reset" buttons in field editors broken. (Mostly
	nothing happened when pressing them.)

2020-12-17  Andras Varga

	* Inifile Editor: Update form editor with new fields.

2020-12-17  Andras Varga

2020-10-09  Andras Varga

	* Analysis Tool redesign, 3rd phase. This is a summary of several hundred
	commits by Attila Torok and Andras Varga, over the period of 2020-01-03
	through 2020-07-23.

	In OMNeT++ 6.0pre9 (2020-05-07 through 2020-07-03):

	- Chart improvements, such as adding error bars to the Matplotlib-based
	  bar chart, and adding confidence interval drawing to the Matplotlib-based
	  scatter chart.

	- UI refinements, such as rearranging the menu items on the Browse Data page.

	- Improved how selection works in the table widget (Browse Data page).

	- Content assist improvements, mainly for the "Input" pages of chart dialogs.

	- Performance improvements, such as enabling vector data caching when
	  pickling results, and memoizing the results of query methods.

	- Countless small improvements and bug fixes.

	In OMNeT++ 6.0pre8 (2020-02-xx through 2020-05-07):

	- The main focus of improvements was to improve the scalability of the new
	  Analysis Tool. Indeed, the UI is now easily capable of dealing with at least
	  several tens of thousands of result files, and a million result items
	  (this was the input routinely used during the development).

	OMNeT++ 6.0pre7 (2020-01-16 through 2020-02-xx):

	- Fix shared memory name issue on macOS. Miscellaneous improvements overall.

2020-09-24  Rudolf Hornig

	* Update Eclipse to 4.17 and CDT to 10.0

2020-08-05  Rudolf Hornig

	* Update to Eclipse 4.16

	* SimpleModule creation wizard: added "override" for functions

2020-04-23 Attila Torok

	* Common: Allow excluding debug channels by prepending "-" to them in
	the OMNETPP_DEBUG environment variable.

2020-04-10  Rudolf Hornig

	* NED Documentation Generator: use project relative path to specify doc-fragment file.

	- if the filename is relative, it is considered relative to the given project
	- if the filename is absolute, it is considered as an absolute workspace path

2020-04-08  Andras Varga

	* NED Documentation Generator: UI refinements; excludedDirs semantic change.

	- excludedDirs: now accepts both space and comma as separator; full
	  workspace paths are expected (if you want to exclude a "foo" dir in all
	  projects, now you need to write "/*/foo")

	- Layout: move excluded dirs and extension fragment file to the top,
	  under project list

	- Mnemonic for menu item

	- Labels shortened

	- Use SWTFactory

2020-04-07  Rudolf Hornig

	* IDE: neddoc generator dialog two column layout to reduce height.

2020-03-31  Rudolf Hornig

	* IDE: add possibility to insert documentation fragments into the generated
	ned documentation

2020-04-15  Andras Varga

	  - Eliminate tons of warnings
	  - Tab-to-space in all projects
	  - Run "organize imports" on all projects

2020-04-15 Attila Torok

	* Add Debug.inDevelopment()

2020-04-15  Rudolf Hornig

	* Removed unused nativelibs.linux.x86 32-bit fragment project.

2020-03-20  Levente Meszaros

	* SequenceChart: Fixed resultFileManager.loadFile call after rebase.

2020-03-20  Levente Meszaros

	* SequenceChart: Reworked the whole implementation including several major
	changes.

	The new chart supports selecting events and axes independently. Axis can
	be expanded and collapsed. Internal data structures are more explicit and
	flexible. Added new selectable objects: axes, method calls, message
	sends. Added the ability to measure time between selected objects.
	Several other unlisted changes.

2020-03-20  Levente Meszaros

	* SequenceChart: Added new filter parameters.

2020-03-20  Levente Meszaros

	* CachingCanvas: Fixed incorrect clipping handling.

2020-03-20  Levente Meszaros

	* SequenceChart: Added a lot of icons for the new actions.

2020-01-06  Levente Meszaros

	* SequenceChart: Started adding support for horizontally finite sized events.
	This allows separating message sends and method calls from each other
	horizontally.

2020-03-20  Levente Meszaros

	* SequenceChart: Factored out a separate style provider.

2020-01-10  Levente Meszaros

	* Fixed translation in CachingCanvas by moving it from GC to
	SWTGraphics. The SWTGraphics will set the transform on GC when
	rotate is called without knowing that there's a transform already set.

2020-02-06  Andras Varga

	* ColorFactory: added asRGBStrict(); asRGB() now validates
	better. Rejects #rgb/@hsb strings of invalid (non-6) length, instead
	of silently returning an incorrect answer.

2020-01-20  Rudolf Hornig

	* Added missing CR at the end of the Makefile template which caused
	unnecessary rebuild of the projects	in IDE, as it did not match the
	opp_makemake template.

2020-01-02  Attila Torok

	* Analysis Tool redesign, 2nd phase. This is a summary of several hundred
	commits Attila Torok, over the period of 2018-08-01 through 2020-01-02.

	The following is a high-level overview of what was achieved.

	Charts are now produced by running user-editable Python scripts that
	rely on NumPy and Pandas. For charting, there are two options: Matplotlib,
	and the Analysis Tool's own chart widgets. The former is more flexible
	and has more features, but the latter scales better.

	Matplotlib integrates smoothly into the IDE. Charts are live, and even
	animated charts work.

	Scripts are run in separate Python processes that communicate with the IDE
	using Py4J. Result data are loaded by the IDE, and the script can query them
	using an API provide by the Analysis Tool. Data are transferred between the
	IDE and the script using serialization (with the Pickle library), and for
	large amounts of data (vectors), using shared memory for better performance.

	Charts can be configured/parameterized using dialogs. Settings entered into
	the dialog are made accessible to the script, and it can freely use them for
	whatever purpose.

	Charts are created using chart templates. Chart templates include the script
	itself, and the description of the associated dialog. The dialog has
	multiple tabs. The contents of dialog tabs (widgets, layout) are defined in
	XML files (we use the XSWT Eclipse plugin). Many chart templates are
	provided, and the user can also create new ones.

	For editing Python code, the Analysis Tool utilizes the editor provided by
	the PyDev Eclipse plugin. Charts are updated live as the user edits the
	code. (The script is run every time the user stops editing for some time.
	This auto-update can be turned off.)

	Charts and their associated scripts and settings are saved into ANF files,
	whose format has completely changed from version 5.x. An effort is made to
	convert old ANF files to the new format when they are opened, but the result
	usually needs manual editing.

	Charts in an ANF file can be exported from the command-line using a tool
	named opp_charttool. opp_charttool does not rely on the IDE (it is written
	in pure Python), but instead emulates the Analysis Tool's Python API.
	Native charts are emulated using Matplotlib. opp_charttool is useful
	for e.g. exporting chart graphics from automated scripts.

2019-12-19  Rudolf Hornig

	* Update to Eclipse 4.14 and CDT 9.10

2019-11-08  Andras Varga

	* Rudimentary IDE support for new parameter type "object" (syntax highlight).

2019-10-28  Attila Torok

	* Sequence Chart: Add a (potential) axis for any module with a custom
	@class, instead of only those that do not have any submodules. These used to
	be the same, but not anymore in INET, with the new "tricky" compound modules
	that handle some messages themselves. This works around issues #759 and
	#778.

2019-11-14  Attila Torok

	* Install INET 4 (the inet4 project) from FirstStepsDialog.

2019-11-20  Rudolf Hornig

	* Model catalog URL updated

2019-09-30  Rudolf Hornig

	* Updated for Eclipse 4.13.

2019-09-13  Andras Varga

	* Added the new example simulations to the IDE.

2019-09-01  Andras Varga

	* NEDDoc: Automatic hyperlinking of URLs embedded in the text.

2019-08-22  Rudolf Hornig

	* Updated splash / about images for OMNeT++ 6.

2019-08-22  Rudolf Hornig

	* Fix an NPE on closing the Welcome view

2019-08-21  Rudolf Hornig

	* Fix incorrect product ID.

2019-07-31  Andras Varga

	* NEDDoc: Generate "Implementors" table for interfaces. Implementors table
	includes indirect implementors as well.

2019-07-31  Andras Varga

	* NEDDoc: fix: Inheritance diagrams were missing in module interface pages,
	even if they had implementors. This bug made INET documentation much less
	useful.

	Cause: hasBaseType was too restrictive, and its value didn't align with
	what generateInheritanceDiagram() was doing.

	Solution: always generate the dot graph, and check afterwards if it has
	content.

2019-07-24  Rudolf Hornig

	* Use bundled private JRE on all platforms.

2019-07-24  Rudolf Hornig

	* Debug launch config to use lldbmi2 by default on macOS.

2019-07-05  Rudolf Hornig

	* Updated to use Eclipse 4.12, CDT 9.8

2019-06-04  Attila Torok

	* CDT: Remove ancient CProjectChecker class. It often caused a
	DeadlockException on startup, and is no longer relevant.

2019-05-08  Attila Torok

	* Remove dependency on the now defunct AERI (error reporting service).

2019-05-27  Rudolf Hornig

	* Fixed bug report and model descriptor download URLs

2019-04-11  Rudolf Hornig

	* Makefile improvements.

2019-03-28  Rudolf Hornig

	* Use fully offline build with network turned off in the docker
	container

2019-03-27  Rudolf Hornig

	* Eclipse 4.11 update, Tycho 1.3.0 update for building

2019-03-04  Rudolf Hornig

	* Renamed the launcher executable to opp_ide. The same launcher name will be
	used in both OMNeT++ and OMNEST

2019-02-28  Rudolf Hornig

	* NEDDoc: NED documentation now can be generated from commandline

2019-02-13  Rudolf Hornig

	* NEDoc: fix: excluded directories were not working when it was empty

2019-02-18  Rudolf Hornig

	* Fix an NPE when MakefileBuilder was running without a workbench window.

2019-02-14  Rudolf Hornig

	* Fix a crash when shared images was accessed in headless mode

2019-02-22  Rudolf Hornig

	* Updated to Eclipse 4.11, tycho 1.3.

2019-02-11  Andras Varga

	* Sequence Chart: follow rename of ModuleMethodBegin/End to ComponentMethodBegin/End.

	Note: the Sequence Chart tool cannot visualize methods calls from/to
	channel objects, as they have no axes in the chart.

2019-02-11  Rudolf Hornig

	* Added a bookmark file specifying all used update sites.

	The site bookmark file can be imported in the Eclipse / Preferences /
	Install/Update / Available Software Sites dialog. It contains update
	sites for Eclipse Platform, CDT, GEF, PyDev, Linux Tools.

2019-01-24  Rudolf Hornig

	* Fixed dependency file generation

	The dependency file generated by a .msg and the related object file's
	dependency file were overwriting each other.

2019-01-18  Rudolf Hornig

	* Build process refactoring

2018-12-05  Rudolf Hornig

	* Releng: moved to the root directory

2018-10-24  Rudolf Hornig

	* NED documentation generator updated. [This is a summary of several commits.]

	  - Generate material design inspired output.

	  - Navigation tree revised.

	  - It is now possible to specify excluded directories during documentation
	    generation, in order to be able to exclude samples, showcases etc. that
	    are not integral part of the documentation.

	  - Now generates nedtags.xml/msgtags.xml file which is compatible with
	    the doxytags.xml file generated by doxygen. This allows crosslinking to
	    the ned documentation from a sphinx based documentation (using the
	    doxy-link plugin)

	  - Generate usage and inheritance diagrams ONLY if they are meaningful.

	  - Use SVG files as the usage/inheritance diagram image. Removed map
	    files as SVG already contains proper links.

2018-11-26  Andras Varga

	* NED Editor, Sequence Chart: allow SVG export.

	* Makemake dialog: allow setting DLL export symbol from OMNeT++.

2018-08-01  Attila Torok

	* CachingCanvas: Remove a workaround for Eclipse bug #245523 (fixed).
	Affects both the Analysis Tool and Sequence Chart Tool.

2017-06-07  Andras Varga

	* Analysis Tool redesign, 1st phase. This is a summary of several commits by Andras
	Varga, 	over the period of 2017-04-07 through 2017-06-07.

	A partial list of changes:

	- Data model change: added Dataset, Chartsheet and Folder

	- Datasets page replaced by an IconGridViewer that displays chart icons.
	  Charts will be created from scripts instead of tree-edited steps like
	  "add", "apply" and "chart".

	- Remove dependency on Eclipse EMF -- ecore data model was replaced by
	  hand-coded classed, to reduce bloat and for greater control.

	- Editor pages: added a toolbar to the top-right inner corner, use that
	  instead of the main Eclipse toolbar.

	- Inputs page redesigned and rewritten (basically from scratch)

	- Browse Data page: filter strip: remove "Apply" button; "Swap" button moved
	  to left

	- Browse Data page: Tree Levels and Choose Table Columns actions added to
	  toolbar

	- Browse Data page: right-align numeric colums

	- Browse Data page: copy to clipboard action: added icon

	- Browse Data page: added Increase/Decrease Precision actions

	- Browse Data page: data tree was missing icons (used a folder icon)
	  for some item types

	- Browse Data page: adjust preset tree levels: "File" -> "File / Run"

	- Browse Data page: table filter: replace RunId filter with
	  Experiment/Measurement/Replication

	- Exporter improvements: validate dialog on start; enable/disable Export
	  action based on the contents of the selection

	- Charts: default legend positioning changed from "off" to "inside,
	  anchor north"

	- During development, existing Analysis Tool code was preserved for reference,
	  as plugins org.omnetpp.scave_orig and org.omnetpp.scave.model_orig, and
	  later removed.

2018-11-22  Andras Varga

	* Removed unused IDE build scripts. Replaced by releng.

2018-11-22  Andras Varga

	* Remove abandoned Standalone Sequence Chart, due to lack of interest.

2018-11-22  Andras Varga

	* Remove abandoned IDE-based animation plugins.

	This was offline animation, i.e. play-back from the eventlog file
	recorded from the simulation.

	This effort pre-dated the Canvas API, OSG/osgEarth support, smooth
	animation using refreshDisplay(), and Qtenv.

	Originally abandoned due to scalability concerns (eventlog file can be
	huge), but now a huge drawback would be lack of support for recent
	animation APIs used with Qtenv (Canvas, OSG/osgEarth, refreshDisplay()).

2018-11-22  Andras Varga

	* Remove the IDE-based simulation front-end plugin, a shelved project.

	This plugin requires a custom Cmdenv, as it communicates with the
	simulation process that runs in the background via HTTP JSON requests.

	This attempt has pre-dated the Canvas API, OSG/osgEarth and Qtenv.
	Abandoned mainly due to scalability concerns (too much socket
	communication between simulation process and GUI front-end), and more
	recently, due to OSG which would be difficult to integrate into Eclipse.

2018-11-22  Andras Varga

	* Removed the abandoned Standalone Analysis Tool, due to lack of interest.

2018-11-22  Andras Varga

	* Removed abandoned GUI tester and usage tracker plugins, unused for ~10
	years.

2018-07-04  Rudolf Hornig

	* Updated to Eclipse 4.8

2018-06-26  Andras Varga

	* Follow change: Remove references to Tkenv.

2020-01-06  ------ omnetpp-5.6 released ------

2020-01-06  Rudolf Hornig

	* Updated to use Eclipse 4.14 and CDT 9.10.

2019-12-13  Andras Varga

	* IDE: Made the "Project Features" menu item more creative in finding
	the project. (It said "Select a project first" much too often.)

2019-10-07  Attila Torok

	* Analysis Tool: Fix weighted histogram PDF/CDF computation (use sum of
	weights instead of observation count).

2019-10-25  Attila Torok

	* NED editor: added manual connection routing using the "m" tag.

2019-10-30  Attila Torok

	* SequenceChart: Avoid out of bounds error when selecting manual axis
	ordering, or switching between "Manual" and "Minimize crossings" modes.

2019-10-28  Attila Torok

	* EventlogTable, SequenceChart: Strip ANSI escape sequences from log
	message lines.

2019-08-24  Andras Varga

	* NED editor: Fix "Failed to create the part's controls" error due to
	"assertion failed: file is not a NED file, or not parsed yet".

2019-08-06  Andras Varga

	* IDE: Let the user permanently turn off the "OMNeT++ libraries not yet
	compiled" dialog.

2019-05-14  Attila Torok

	* IDE: Remove AERI (now defunct logging service) reference.

2018-11-20  Attila Torok

	* IDE: Avoid NPE when web browser could not be created.

2019-02-11  Andras Varga

	* NED editor: fix recently introduced runtime error during connecting
	nodes.

2018-07-20  Rudolf Hornig

	* IDE: Fix: NedType and Msgtape tags had different value in C++ and Java.

2019-12-06  Rudolf Hornig

	* Updated to use Eclipse 4.13, CDT 9.9.

2019-05-15  ------ omnetpp-5.5 released ------

2019-04-26  Rudolf Hornig

	* fix NPE in workspace import when the initial welcome screen closed
	on the latest eclipse

2019-03-25  Rudolf Hornig

	* Updated tycho/antrunner/pomless plugin versions + fixed version
	number replacements

2019-03-21  Rudolf Hornig

	* Use Eclipse 4.11, CDT 9.7

2019-02-09  Andras Varga

	* ide: removing "bgl" display string tag

	Store seed in the figure instead of the display string tag. Change
	Relayout action accordingly.

	The "bgl" could be used to specify the layout seed for the compound
	module. It has not been supported by Qtenv, as it was unclear how it was
	supposed to coexist with Qtenv's "Relayout" button. We are now removing
	it altogether.

2018-07-06  Rudolf Hornig

	* Fixed the trashy cursors during connection drag and new module
	creation with GTK3. The IDE now runs with GTK3. Both the cursor issue
	and the missing 3-state checkbox issue in the launcher dialog has been fixed.

2018-06-25  ------ omnetpp-5.4.1 released ------

2018-06-13  Andras Varga

	* NED: fix: in a "compound-extends-simple" situation, base was not
	added to the inheritance chain

	simple A {
	   gates:
	       inout g;
	}

	module B extends A {  // <---- despite this, internally B did NOT extend
	A
	}

	module C {
	   submodules:
	       b1: B;
	       b2: B;
	   connections:
	       b1.g <--> b2.g; // ERROR (bogus): gate 'g' not found in 'B'
	}

2018-06-13  Levente Meszaros

	* NED editor: Solved unused deep parameter assignment in NED file
	analysis.

	moduleinterface IMac
	{
	}

	module Mac like IMac
	{
	   parameters:
	       int x;
	}

	module Test
	{
	   parameters: WARN-->     mac.x = 2;
	   submodules:
	       mac: <default("Mac")> like IMac;
	}

2018-06-13  Andras Varga

	* NED: fix: when a compound module extends a simple module, references to
	the base module's gates and parameters were reported as errors ("unknown
	gate", etc.)

2018-06-13  Levente Meszaros

	* NED editor: Solved unused deep parameter assignment in NED file analysis

2018-06-11  ------ omnetpp-5.4 released ------

2018-06-05  Attila Torok

	* Launcher: fix: The IDE sometimes started build in the UI thread,
	locking up the UI for the time of the build, potentially for several
	minutes.

2018-06-05  Attila Torok

	* Fix "unknown" image as module background in the graphical NED	editor.

2018-06-04  Andras Varga

	* Fix: do not report "undefined parameter" for typename assignments in NED

2018-06-01  Andras Varga

	* Fix: inifile analysis: typename deep assignments in NED were ignored

2018-04-11  ------ omnetpp-5.3 released ------

2018-03-08  Rudolf Hornig

	* Fix: added --add-modules vm argument to eclipse.ini to be compatible
	with JDK 9

2017-11-22  Rudolf Hornig

	* Makefile generator: follow opp_makemake change: generate dependency
	files for .msg files too (if they use imports)

2017-11-30  Andras Varga

	* Updated for nedxml library changes

2017-12-08  ------ omnetpp-5.2.1 released ------

2017-12-08  Rudolf Hornig

	* Launcher: fix for program name validation.

2017-09-18  ------ omnetpp-5.2 released ------

2017-09-18  Andras Varga

	* Removed "Add OMNeT++ Support" from the "File" menu

	Reason: it did not add C++ support.

	Replacement: delete the project from the workspace (but leave its
	files!), and create a project over it using the "New OMNeT++ Project"
	wizard. You existing files will appear under the new project.

2017-09-18  Andras Varga

	* Makemake Options dialog: layout fixes

2017-08-25  Andras Varga

	* Launching: no not offer ".qtenv.ini" when creating launch
	configuration

2017-07-16  Andras Varga

	* Analysis Tool: Updated for 'statistic' items and for weighted statistics.

	Background: Specifying "record=stats" in a @statistic NED property, or
	or calling the record() method on a cStddDev object saves a "statistic"
	object in the output scalar file (.sca). A "statistic" object includes
	fields like the count of observations, mean, standard deviation, minimum
	and maximum value. "statistic" objects so far have been blown up to
	several unrelated scalars upon loading into the Analysis Tool, and were
	not available as objects. Now they are loaded as objects, and appear in
	the Histograms and All tabs of the Browse Data page. Statistics fields
	continue to be available as scalars as well, so they can be used as
	chart input.

	Also, weighted statistics (like those saved from cWeightedStddev) were
	not properly displayed in the Analysis Tool. This has been rectified
	as well.

	Details:
	- The Histograms tab on the Browse Data page now includes "statistics"-
	  type results as well.

	- The Histograms tab now has new table columns: "Kind", "SumWeights",
	  "#Bins", "Hist.Range", all displayed by default. "Kind" indicates
	  whether a result item is a "statistic" or a "histogram", and whether
	  it is weighted or unweighted.

	- Individual fields of "statistic" and "histogram" result items are
	  no longer displayed on the Scalars page.

	- Properties for "statistic" and "histogram" result items now includes
	  "Kind" ("weighted"/"unweighted") and "Sum of weights".

	- The "Variance" line has been removed from Properties view because
	  it's not too useful and can be easily computed as the square of the
	  standard deviation.

	- Missing or unavailable data in table cells is now displayed with a
	  hyphen instead of "n.a."

	- On the All tab of Browse Data page, result item fields are now in
	  natural order (i.e. no longer in alphabetically sorted).

	- New icon for scalar items on the All tab of Browse Data page

2017-06-27  Andras Varga

	* Analysis Tool: better display of histogram bins in the Properties view.
	The display format of bins was changed from "a..b" to "[a,b)", in order
	to clearly indicate that "a" is	inclusive and "b" is exclusive.

2017-06-21  Andras Varga

	* Analysis Tool: Export dialog refined

	- Dialog now comes up with correct size (XSWT form fully visible)
	- Better filename generation/validation
	- Disable Finish button when filename field is empty
	- Added 'Open exported file afterwards' checkbox
	- Other refinements

2017-04-06  Andras Varga

	* Analysis Tool: final removal of export code (it was no longer
	accessible from	the GUI since version 5.1.)

2017-04-04  Andras Varga

	* Analysis Tools: changed the syntax for accessing iteration variables
	in filter expressions. Before, they could be accessed like run attributes,
	with the "attr:" prefix. Now, one needs to use the "itervar:" prefix,
	which is more explicit.

2017-03-31  Andras Varga

	* Analysis Tool: Properties view: properly display attributes, iteration
	variables and parameter assignments for runs

2017-03-20  Andras Varga

	* Analysis Tool: Properties view: removed "Number of lines" and
	"Unrecognized lines" entries from the properties of result files

2017-06-23  Rudolf Hornig

	* IDE: updated Eclipse for the final Oxygen release

2017-06-08  Rudolf Hornig

	* Run/Debug Launchers: changes related to "build before launch" and
	recent changes in debug/release builds.

	- The Run, Profile and Debug launch types now automatically trigger build.

	- The launcher now switches the project (and optionally all projects it
	  depends on) to the appropriate build configuration if necessary: Run
	  and Profile will perform RELEASE build, Debug will perform DEBUG build.

	- For Debug launch, the "_dbg" suffix is added implicitly to the target
	  name (both exe and shared lib), and it is expected that the simulation
	  will also load the "_dbg" versions of libraries.

	- A new "Build before launch" section was added to the Launch config
	  dialog, which allows you to control whether to switch build configuration
	  automatically, or ask before the build. The scope of build can also
	  configured; options are: "None", "This project", or "Project + dependencies".

	- If the launch is configured as "Ask before build" (default), a
	  confirmation dialog is shown on launch (and before the build), asking
	  whether to switch the active build configuration to appropriate one.
	  The dialog allows you to set the decision as permanent and reconfigures
	  the launch config accordingly.

2017-05-26  Rudolf Hornig

	* Makefile generator: follow changes in the command-line opp_makemake tool

	- Models are built in RELEASE mode by default. Until now, DEBUG was the
	  default, which resulted in casual users always running their simulations
	  in DEBUG mode, i.e. much slower than possible.

	- RELEASE and DEBUG mode binaries can now co-exist, so users do not have
	  to recompile when they switch modes (e.g. when they want to debug a
	  simulation -- remember, they are built in RELEASE mode by default.)
	  This is a significant gain especially for large models like INET.
	  The goal was achieved by adding the "_dbg" suffix to the names of
	  DEBUG-mode binaries.

	- Binaries are now hard-linked from the build directory (out/) to the
	  target directory instead of being soft-linked. This leaves the copy
	  in the build directory intact when the one in the target directory
	  is deleted.

2017-05-29  Rudolf Hornig

	* IDE: Use statically linked stdc++ library for the IDE native lib for
	better compatibility.

2017-05-12  Rudolf Hornig

	* Simulation Launcher: better progress reporting and cancellation
	for batch runs. Internally, this is the result of switching to the
	new JobGroups API of Eclipse.

2017-05-11  Rudolf Hornig

	* IDE: use Eclipse Oxygen milestone builds (platform version 4.6.2)

2017-05-29  Rudolf Hornig

	* The IDE's native library is now using statically linked c++ standard
	library to avoid binary dependency on libstdc++. This reduces the possibility
	of compatibility issues on older systems.

2017-05-08  ------ omnetpp-5.1.1 released ------

2017-04-29  Rudolf Hornig

	* IDE: Fixed a problem where the IDE was not able to load its native
	library	if it was not started from the MinGW shell.

	* The IDE now properly detects whether it is using MinGW or Clang/C2.

2017-03-31  ------ omnetpp-5.1 released ------

2017-03-10  Andras Varga

	* Analysis Tool: switch to using the new exporters in the scave library
	and new Export dialog.

2017-02-21  Andras Varga

	* Analysis Tool: Old export wizard renamed

2017-03-04  Andras Varga

	* nativelibs: tweak SWIG wrapping to accommodate changes in the scave library

2017-03-16  Andras Varga

	* nativelibs: tweak SWIG wrapping to accommodate changes in the scave library

2017-02-17  Andras Varga

	* Analysis Tool: remove octave and matlab export from the IDE

	Reasons:

	1. poor data representation chosen in the output file, esp. for vector
	   (one time vector, and one value vector per OMNeT++ output vector,
	   where most values were NaN due to the common T vector!
	   2-column matrices for each vector would have been a better choice.)

	2. We don't want to promote Matlab/Octave use for result analysis.
	   Matlab/Octave users should use CSV export.

	Note: octaveexport.cc/h were unused (not in build).

2017-03-10  Andras Varga

	* nativelibs: allow C++11 (compiler flag comes from CXXFLAGS)

2017-02-16  Andras Varga

	* nativelibs: added missing %ignore

2017-03-16  Andras Varga

	* Fix NPE when deleting folder in a non-C++ project

2017-03-13  Rudolf Hornig

	* build: use Eclipse 4.6.3 milestone builds

2017-03-17  Rudolf Hornig

	* NPE and logging fixes

2017-03-09  Rudolf Hornig

	* Makefile generation: follow opp_makemake change: improved the "clean"
	target in the generated makefiles (recursive wildcard; delete only the
	actual target)

2017-03-03  Levente Meszaros

	* Sequence Chart: Eventlog view: selection handling fixes
	   - Temporarily disabled reusing selection (due to NPE) after filtering
	     the eventlog
	   - Fixed dangling focusElement on input change.
	   - Changed selection marks to be more apparent.
	   - Fixed revealing selected element in VirtualTable.

2017-03-03  Levente Meszaros

	* Sequence Chart: Eventlog view: Fixed foreground color when the table
	widget is not focused.

2017-03-02  Andras Varga

	* Inifile Editor: fix #941: Recursively including ini file makes
	OMNeT++ workspace unusable

2017-03-03  Andras Varga

	* Inifile Editor: parser: ParseException is never used, eliminated.
	Also: wrap IOException into CoreException

2017-03-03  Andras Varga

	* Launch dialog fix: debug-on-errors did not take effect for DEBUG
	launch on a fresh launch config. Just opening and closing the Debug
	dialog fixed it (it wrote the setting into the launch config).

2017-03-02  Andras Varga

	* Launch dialog page: fix: config name "Gen" could not be restored.

	"General" was chosen instead, because code used simple startsWith() call
	to test, and "General" came before "Gen" in the list (??).

2017-03-02  Andras Varga

	* Inifile Editor: fix: form edits were lost when typing too quickly
	after hitting Enter. Cause: reread() overwrote user's edits.

2017-03-02  Andras Varga

	* Inifile Editor: Fix #1001: form editor: "Reset to default" button
	pops up "No such entry" error dialog

2017-03-03  Rudolf Hornig

	* Added default Eclipse repositories as update sites

2017-03-02  Rudolf Hornig

	* Added automatic Eclipse reporting support to OMNeT++ (not to OMNEST)

2017-03-02  Rudolf Hornig

	* Removed dummy MSVC toolchain definition

2017-03-03  Levente Meszaros

	* SequenceChart: Changed selection marks to be more apparent.

	* SequenceChart: Fixed revealing selected element in VirtualTable.

	* SequenceChart: Fixed foreground color for EventLogTable when the widget is not
	focused.

2017-03-02  Andras Varga

	* Fix #941: Recursively including ini file makes OMNeT workspace
	unusable

	* Launcher fix: debug-on-errors did not take effect on a fresh launch
	config

	* Launch dialog page: fix: config name "Gen" could not be restored.
	"General" was chosen instead, because code used simple startsWith() call
	to test, and "General" came before "Gen" in the list...

	* Ini editor fix: edits lost when typing too quickly after hitting
	Enter

	* Fix #1001: Ini form editor: "Reset to default" button pops up "No
	such entry" error dialog

2017-03-03  Rudolf Hornig

	* Added default eclipse repositories as update sites

	* Added automatic Eclipse reporting support to OMNeT++ (not to OMNEST)

	* Removed dummy MSVC toolchain definition

2017-02-06  ------ omnetpp-5.1pre3 released ------

2017-02-01  Rudolf Hornig

	* Added CDT repo so plugins can be installed from there directly (It
	was required to add LLDB debugger support as it is not part of the main
	repo.

2017-01-27  Andras Varga

	* "New empty project" wizard: do NOT generate package.ned. Change fixes
	the TicToc tutorial.

2017-01-27  Rudolf Hornig

	* Added lldb support plugins

2017-01-27  Rudolf Hornig

	* Upgraded to Eclipse 4.6.2

2017-01-26  Rudolf Hornig

	* The IDE now generates exactly the same makefile as the opp_makemake
	tool. This allows easier switching between IDE and command line without
	rebuilding the model.

2017-01-16  Andras Varga

	* Fix tri-state checkboxes. Affects launch dialog and Analysis tool chart
	properties dialog.

2017-01-11  Rudolf Hornig

	* neddoc: made the doxy file path relative to the project. This fixes the
	issue in windows.

2016-11-21  Levente Meszaros

	* Debug launch: GDB init file changed from python2 to python3 syntax

2016-12-23  ------ omnetpp-5.1pre2 released ------

2016-12-19  Andras Varga

	* IDE: Inifile editor updated with new/changed options

2016-12-16  Rudolf Hornig

	* IDE: updated logo images

2016-11-25  Andras Varga

	* Analysis tool: initial support for SQLite-based result files [Zoltan
	Bojthe, Rudolf Hornig, Andras Varga]

2016-12-05  Rudolf Hornig

	* Build: renamed default config names from gcc-debug -> debug.

2016-12-01  Rudolf Hornig

	* Build: removed Visual C++ specific code, as now we support the
	Visual C++ compiler with the normal makefiles and build mechanism.

2016-11-18  Andras Varga

	* Inifile editor, Launcher: support for cmdenv-stop-batch-on-error

2016-11-11  Andras Varga

	* Launch page: "Silent" checkbox replaced by "Verbose"

2016-11-14  Andras Varga

	* Launch page: more/better tooltips

2016-11-18  Andras Varga

	* Launcher: don't force --debug-on-errors=false in RUN mode. Reason:
	user may want to launch simulation using RUN, and use an external
	debugger to debug it.

2016-11-14  Andras Varga

	* Launch page: "Debug on errors" made tri-state checkbox

2016-11-14  Andras Varga

	* Launcher: added hint for the run filter

2016-11-14  Andras Varga

	* IDE: omnetpp-ide.launch updated

2016-11-16  Andras Varga

	* Project Features: detecting external changes in the generated header file
	made more robust: made comparison insensitive to comment, whitespace and
	order differences.

2016-11-16  Andras Varga

	* Project Features property page: fix: could not properly fix NED
	exclusions list

	The old NED exclusions list always came back after "fixing" the project
	configuration from the Project Features property page. (.nedexclusions
	with updated content was saved to disk, then on "Apply" it was
	overwritten with old content.)

2016-10-27  Andras Varga

	* Launcher improvements

	- tolerate lack of console (no NPE in stream monitor)
	- on simulation error, display concrete message in the error dialog,
	  not just "Finished with error"
	- code structuring for readability

2016-10-27  Andras Varga

	* Launch page: UI revamp

	- use tristate checkboxes instead of Yes/No/Default radio buttons or combos
	- UI: use editable combo instead
	- working dir merged into Simulation group
	- Qtenv to precede Tkenv
	- Batch settings into separate group
	- introduced explicit "useBatching" checkbox
	- debug-on-errors: replace combo with checkbox that appears only in DEBUG
	  mode (and fixed "false" in RUN mode)
	- use our own SWTFactory
	- added simulation time limit / CPU time limit
	- added content assist for Additional Arguments
	- hook modificatoin listeners automatically
	- etc.

2016-10-07  Andras Varga

	* Launcher: allow simulations execute in batches

	OmnetppMainTab: added "Batch size" spinner, etc.

	Added JobGroup-based alternative implementation code as comment (it
	currently does not work, because progress reporting from job groups is
	broken, see Eclipse bugtracker)

2016-10-20  Rudolf Hornig

	* IDE: set all plugin's minimum runtime requirement to JRE 1.8

2016-10-20  Rudolf Hornig

	* IDE: Updated to eclipse 4.6.1

2016-10-19  Andras Varga

	* Fix NPE on startup when open ANF file was deleted since last session

2016-10-19  Andras Varga

	* Analysis tool: display Experiment/Measurement/Replication columns in
	Browse Data tables instead of Folder/Filename/RunId/Config/RunNumber.

	Note that this is only the default values for a preference, so change
	will only take effect in new installations (or delete delete scave
	preferences from .metadata/org.eclipse.core.runtime/...)

	Also: increase default columns widths

2016-10-19  Andras Varga

	* Analysis tool: updated generation of default anf file names from
	vec/sca file names

2016-10-12  Andras Varga

	* Launcher: make simulation batch cancellable; getting run list was
	broken by a recent commit

2016-10-12  Levente Meszaros

	* Fixed incorrect tooltip background/foreground colors.

	Added colorLock flag to prevent the eclipse styling mechanism from
	overriding colors already set on the widget. Added kludge to workaround
	the fact that the HTML parser returns black colors for
	foreground/background even when they were not specified. Removed colors
	from HTML prolog to fallback to system defaults.

2016-10-10  Andras Varga

	* Analysis tool: dark scheme fix

2016-10-10  Andras Varga

	* NED editor: improvement for dark color schemes (removed grey strip
	from "package" heading)

2016-10-10  Andras Varga

	* Inifile edtor: icons: better transparency (for dark color schemes)

2016-10-10  Andras Varga

	* Inifile form editor: improvements for the dark color scheme

2016-10-10  Andras Varga

	* Inifile editor: fix "widget already disposed" error

2016-10-05  Levente Meszaros

	* Fixed incorrect swig mapping for ptr_t/uintptr_t.

2016-11-30  Rudolf Hornig

	* Removed 'nmake' support from the IDE. The Microsoft Clang/C2 compiler
	now works with the same configuration as the MinGW compiler.

	* Added support for 64-bit builds with both the MinGW-W64 and the Clang/C2
	compilers.

2016-08-04  Rudolf Hornig

	* While detecting the omnetpp_root directory, check all parent
	directories for Makefile.inc

2016-08-03  Rudolf Hornig

	* build: removed 32-bit linux support for the IDE

2016-07-20  Rudolf Hornig

	* build: The native IDE build script now creates Windows 64, Linux 64 and
	macOS shared libraries.

2016-05-23  Rudolf Hornig

	* The IDE build system is now using Eclipse 4.6 and Maven/Tycho

2016-05-27  Rudolf Hornig

	* Removed deprecated construct + handled IllegalArgumentException when
	invalid path is entered in the IMAGE_PATH

2016-07-08  Andras Varga

	* Project Features: features.h banner change, and more fixes

	- fix NPE when opening Project Features dialog for a project with no
	  features defined
	- String getDefinesFileName() -> IFile getDefinesFile()

2016-07-05  Andras Varga

	* test/* added IDE test projects for testing the linker/compiler
	options, include path etc. [Rudi]

	Exercises the following IDE build features:
	- multiple projects
	- multiple makemake folders per project
	- target types: static lib, shared lib, executable
	- linked project (i.e. not directly under the workspace dir)
	- project references, >2 deep
	- project features (.oppfeatures)
	- include folders: defined in CDT (Paths&Symbols page), by project
	  features, and in makemake -I options
	- defines: defined ibn CDT (Paths&Symbols page), by project features, and
	  in makemame -D options
	- message files, used in referenced projects

	Pass criteria:
	- project must compile, resulting executable must start
	- content of generated makefiles is checked against a saved copy

2016-07-05  Andras Varga

	* ProjectFeaturesManager: warn for missing definesFile attribute

2016-07-01  Andras Varga

	* ProjectFeaturesManager: offer removing "WITH_TCP" etc macros from
	CDT configuration. Now they come from header file, and only cause
	confusion.

2016-07-01  Andras Varga

	* Added BuildSpecFolderRenameDetector, MsgFileRemoveDetector

	They:
	- remove _m.cc/h files when their msg is deleted
	- make .oppbuildspec files follow folder renames

2016-07-04  Andras Varga

	* MetaMakemake: convert paths to relative for makemake

2016-07-04  Andras Varga

	* MetaMakemake: collect include path recursively; linker settings:
	only use directly referenced projects

2016-07-01  Andras Varga

	* MetaMakemake: renames; add -L for referenced projects even if we
	dont automatically link with their libs

2016-07-01  Andras Varga

	* MetaMakemake: better values for the FOO_PROJ=... variables

2016-07-05  Andras Varga

	* MetaMakemake: fix include path exported from referenced projects

2016-06-29  Andras Varga

	* MetaMakemake: refactor: split up addFeatureCFlagsTo() /
	addFeatureLDFlagsTo()

2016-07-01  Andras Varga

	* MakemakeOptionsPanel: remember manually added -L options

2016-07-05  Andras Varga

	* MakemakeOptionsPanel: Compile tab: put some options under a More>>>
	link

2016-07-05  Andras Varga

	* MakemakeOptionsPanel: disable useFeatureLDFlagsCheckbox if not
	applicable

2016-07-01  Andras Varga

	* MakemakeOptionsPanel: don't lose manually entered options in the
	Preview pane

2016-06-30  Andras Varga

	* MakemakeOptionsPanel: added note, wrap label

2016-07-05  Andras Varga

	* MakemakeOptionsPanel: added checkboxes for metaFeatureCFlags and
	metaFeatureLDFlags

2016-06-30  Andras Varga

	* MakemakeOptionsPanel: make MakemakeOptionsDialog resizable

2016-06-29  Andras Varga

	* MakemakeOptionsPanel: added Include directories listbox to the
	Compile page

2016-06-30  Andras Varga

	* MakemakeOptions: added "." as default include dir

2016-06-29  Andras Varga

	* MakemakeOptions: change order of generated options

2016-06-29  Rudolf Hornig

	* Build: for gmake builds removed the CONFIGNAME from the invokation
	command line.

	Make will use the automatically detected toolchain name (detected by
	./configure). In practice this means that once a project is built from
	the IDE, issuing a make command from the command line will not rebuild it
	from scratch.

2016-06-29  Andras Varga

	* Project Features property page: validate the saved project state,
	not the edited one

2016-07-05  Andras Varga

	* Project Features property page: removed "Export build tester
	makefile" feature. We now have an opp_featuretool-based shell script
	for the same purpose.

2016-06-28  Andras Varga

	* Project Features: handle defines with generated header file instead
	of macros in the CDT project configuration. Needs definesFile="..."
	in the root element of .oppfeatures

	* ProjectFeaturesPropertyPage: display name of generated header file

2016-06-28  Andras Varga

	* Metamakemake: use absolute paths for -L, it will be converted
	to relative inside the Makemake class later (in a better way than
	makeRelativePath() can)

2016-06-28  Andras Varga

	* Added metaExportIncludePath, metaUseExportedIncludePaths

2016-07-05  Andras Varga

	* Removed deep-includes option from the IDE and opp_makemake

	As it turned out, it was not all that useful (too error-prone
	for large projects like INET where it was originally targeted)

2016-06-24  Andras Varga

	* IncludeFoldersCache: cache deep-include folders ONLY (based on
	makemake options)

	Don't add non-deepinclude makemake folders to the include path -- if
	that's needed, it should be done explicitly in the Paths&Symbols page.

2016-06-24  Andras Varga

	* Makemake: removed Autoinclude option -- always use include folders
	from the Path&Symbols page

	It was convenient but a messy, for example the -I options in the generate
	Makefiles did not match with the contents of the Paths&Symbols page.

	Better make everything explicit -- and more predictable.

2016-06-24  Andras Varga

	* IncludeFoldersCache changes:
	1. fix: skip non-omnetpp projects
	2. rewrite to discover and maintain list of include folders, base on makemake options

2016-06-28  Andras Varga

	* Removed dependency cache from the IDE.

	Remaining issue: MetaMakemake used to take automatic include folders from
	DependencyCache, this no longer works

2016-06-24  Andras Varga

	* Fix: don't save makemake options for non-makemake folders

2016-06-28  Andras Varga

	* Fix long-standing MetaMakemake bug

2016-06-23  Rudolf Hornig

	* Makefile now uses compiler-generated dependency files.

2013-12-20  ------ omnetpp-4.4 released ------

2013-10-15  Rudolf Hornig

	Fixed the launcher not to throw error if the toolchain is clang.

2013-10-14  Rudolf Hornig

	Now using Eclipse 4.3.1 as base for the IDE

2013-09-13  Tamas Borbely

	Implemented project specific image searches. The "image" folder of the
	project and its dependency projects are added to the image path. New image
	path is automatically used by the NED editor and other places where module
	are displayed. (Folder name is hardcoded now; this will be configurable
	in future releases).

	Additional changes:
	- Launch dialog contains a field to specify the --tkenv-image-path option;
	  by default its value is populated with the image path of the project
	  containing the working directory.
	- Added ${opp_image_path:dir} variable substitution.
	- Caches are invalidated if OMNETPP_IMAGE_PATH, the project dependencies, or
	  the image directories or files have changed.

	Also: NED palette scales images to 16x16 and 24x24. Previously the aspect
	ratio was kept.

2013-10-01  Andras Varga

	* Analysis Tool: name of 'substract' filter changed to 'subtract' (typo)

2013-09-30  Levente Meszaros

	Sequence Chart: Fixed error handling when the error occurs in paint during
	startup.

2013-09-12  ------ omnetpp-4.3.1 released ------

2013-09-12  Levente Meszaros, Andras Varga

	When the IDE is started with an empty workspace (e.g. on first-time
	launch), a dialog comes up automatically that offers the user the
	following options for getting something into the workspace:

	- Import the OMNeT++ sample simulations into the workspace
	- Download and install INET Framework

	The latter function is also available now via the Help > Install
	Simulation Models... menu item. The menu item brings up a dialog
	with the list of simulation models available for automated installation,
	and lets the user choose. Currently only the INET Framework is
	listed there, but it is planned to add further models.

2013-09-12  Levente Meszaros, Andras Varga

	When the IDE was started for the first time, the user formerly saw an
	empty workbench window (apart from the imported samples). Now some
	helpful introductory pages are displayed in the editor area:

	- "Getting Started" - practical advice for getting past the first
	  10 minutes spent in the IDE

	- "At a Glance" - explains the common file types (NED, msg, ini) and
	  their purposes

	- "The Simulation Examples" - explains each example simulation in two
	  sentences, then provides links for opening the project, viewing the
	  README, launching the simulation, etc.

	These pages are also available in the Help system (except the last one,
	which has a dedicated menu item under the Help menu.)

2013-09-06  Andras Varga

	Run dialog > OMNeT++ Simulation > Launch tab: bug fixes:
	- pasting "a}" into the Working dir field caused weird behavior
	- pasting ${ into workingDir caused error dialog

2013-08-28  Andras Varga

	* IDE: import sample projects even if workspace is different from omnetpp/samples

2013-06-06  Levente Meszaros

	Changed default appearance of the main welcome page to be more user friendly.

2013-09-03  Andras Varga

	* IDE: trying to launch a closed project will now offer opening it

2013-08-26  Levente Meszaros

	Neddoc: fixed bug 672: Added escaping for replacement string.

2013-08-07  Tamas Borbély

	Output Vector View: show 'Goto ...' actions in the context menu
	(instead of the view's pulldown menu)

2013-08-07  Tamas Borbély

	Analysis Tool: fix #389 (Useless items in the Statistic Name filter)

	The filter hints of combos is now computed from the result items filtered
	by the other 2 combos.

2013-08-06  Tamas Borbély

	Analysis Tool: fix #388 (add '*.host[*].*' variant to module filter hints)

2013-08-09  Rudolf Hornig

	command line: fix for #670 -vmargs conflict between omnetpp.ini and
	the launcher script.

2013-04-02  ------ omnetpp-4.3 released ------

2013-03-17  Rudolf Hornig

	The debugger no longer stops at the main() symbol by default.

	Updated the IDE to Eclipse 3.8.2

2013-02-08  ------ omnetpp-4.3rc1 released ------

2012-12-17  Rudolf Hornig

	Debugging: the default gdbinit file is now ${opp_root}/misc/gdb/gdbinit.py
	when a new launch configuration is created.

	Also added support for project-specific gdbinit files: the .gdbinit.py
	script in the project root is now automatically sourced by the default
	init script. Project-specific gdbinit files can be used to initialize
	pretty printers specific to the project.

2011-11-15  Rudolf Hornig

	Launcher: for the running program, the configuration name is now
	correctly displayed in the Console view.

2012-12-11  Rudolf Hornig

	Debugging: switched over to the newer DSF debugger framework of CDT.

2012-11-30  Rudolf Hornig, Andras Varga

	* IDE: Added support for opening files from the command line, i.e. the command

	  $ omnetpp Aloha.ned Aloha.cc

	will work as expected (opens these files on startup). If necessary,
	the IDE will open the containing projects if they are closed, and will
	even offer creating/importing a project if the files are outside all
	workspace projects.

2012-11-21  Levente Meszaros

	EventLog, Sequence Chart: better error reporting

2012-11-13  Rudolf Hornig

	CDT: disabled Code Analysis by default. It displayed tons of bogus
	"Semantic Errors" that totally confused novice users.

2012-11-06  Rudolf Hornig

	Command line: the build output is now less verbose (for gcc/mingw).
	Only the file names are printed when building, not whole command lines.

2012-10-24  Rudolf Hornig

	Productizing: updated to Eclipse 3.8.1, removed our own linuxtools
	feature, changed to Cocoa framework from Carbon on OS X, moved to Java
	1.6 as a minimum requirement.

2012-10-16  Levente Meszaros

	Common: avoid showing a hover while any mouse button is pressed

2012-10-15  Tamas Borbely

	* Analysis Tool: BaseLineChartEditForm: no loss of settings when clicking on lines
	without pressing Apply first

	The content of the controls are saved temporarily as properties of the
	selected lines.

2012-10-15  Tamas Borbely

	* Analysis Tool: fix #604: display names were reset after setting another line
	property in the Properties dialog

2012-10-10  Tamas Borbely

	* Analysis Tool: use set display names on legend of scatter charts

2012-10-07  Andras Varga

	* IDE: registered "Small font" (appears in the Preferences dialog)

2012-10-11  Andras Varga

	* Analysis Tool: remember last open tab of Chart Properties dialog

2012-10-13  Andras Varga

	Launcher: fix NPE

2012-08-29  Andras Varga

	Launcher: dialog: fix NPE when processing an omnetpp.ini without section header
	Launcher: dialog main page: cosmetics on labels

2012-10-09  Levente Meszaros, Andras Varga

	* IDE: use StyledText instead of Browser for HTML hover information

	Motivation: The Browser widget is not always available on all platforms
	(constant xulrunner problems on Linux, etc).

2012-10-09  Levente Meszaros

	* IDE: added Full Screen menu item, bound to Ctrl+Shift+F11

2012-07-17  Tamas Borbely

	* Analysis Tool: major feature: implementation of computed scalars

2012-07-09  Tamas Borbely

	* Analysis Tool: fix #754: user defined chart area (minX/maxX/minY/maxY) can now
	be larger than the plot area computed from the data

2012-07-09  Tamas Borbely

	* Analysis Tool: fix #573/2: added hot keys for switching between the Vectors,
	Scalars, Histograms, All pages in the Browse Data page

	For switching between Inputs/Browse Data/Dataset pages, Alt+PgUp/PgDown
	can be used.

2012-07-09  Tamas Borbely

	* Analysis Tool: fix #573: do not switch to VectorBrowser/Dataset view on page
	changes in the Browse Data page

2012-06-27  Tamas Borbely

	* Analysis Tool: add 'logarithmic X axis' option to scatter chart (bug #573)

2012-10-03  Rudolf Hornig

	SeqChart: better error messages for the Goto Simulation Time dialog

2012-03-28  Andras Varga

	* Launcher: fix ".cc file cannot be launched" bug. Now we interpret
	it that as if the file's parent folder was selected.

2012-01-15  Andras Varga

	* IDE: added named connections support to:
	- Property View
	- Properties Dialog in graphical mode
	- content assist in NED editor

	TODO: inifile editor

2012-03-26  Andras Varga

	* IDE: fix: change remaining KB/MB to KiB/MiB

2012-03-13  Rudolf Hornig

	* Analysis Tool: removed export support for Matlab script output.
	The generated script was syntactically incorrect, plus Matlab uses only
	the first 63 chars as identifiers, and this causes collisions between names.

	CSV should be used as data export for Matlab.

2012-03-12  Rudolf Hornig

	CDT: fix #532: Makemake and Project Features pages are now displayed
	only if the project is both OMNeT++ and CDT project

2012-03-13  ------ omnetpp-4.2.2 released ------

2012-01-17  ------ omnetpp-4.2.1 released ------

2011-10-28  ------ omnetpp-4.2 released ------

2011-09-11  ------ omnetpp-4.2rc1 released ------

2011-05-27 Rudolf Hornig

	* Before running a simulation, the IDE will show the command line in
	 the console view to help you execute the same simulation from the
	 command line.

	* CTRL-TAB now works on freshly opened NED files even if you do not explicitly
	 select a simple module. In this case the IDE opens the .h and .cc files
	 associated with the first simple module in the NED file.

	open networks containing around 10.000 submodules.

	* Performance: NED validation is done now in a background thread

2011-02-03 Rudolf Hornig

	* Graphical editor: Figure borders and outlines now correctly follow the zoom level.

	* Graphical editor: The resize/move feedback figures have been changed to
	transparent blue from a simple outline.

2011-02-03 Levente Meszaros

	* Added Technology Preview version of the network animator. It works only
	on .elog files smaller than 10Mb. You can open it by right clicking on an
	.elog file and selection "Open with...". This implementation is NOT optimized
	for larger files.

2011-02-01 Rudolf Hornig

	* NED Files are refreshed now before opening. No more "file is out of sync"
	message if the opened NED file was modified outside of the IDE.

2011-02-01 Andras Varga

	* Simulation launcher: Size of the popup information tooltip is limited
	when displaying all the runs (i.e. whan the parameter space is too big)

2011-01-31 Levente Meszaros

	* Added the possibility to go to a specific simulation time in event log

2011-01-24 Rudolf Hornig

	* Context menu in graphical editor is reorganized for better and easier access of the
	 most used functions.

	* Linux tools now included in the build. It allows to profile the simulation
	using Valgrind on Linux systems. (Windows and Mac builds does not have
	this capability). Use the "Profile as" menu item in the context menu of
	the project directory.

2011-01-21 Rudolf Hornig

	* Go to C++ definiton (CTRL-TAB) now correctly finds the appropriate C++ class even if the
	NED type is extending another type or it is using the @class property. (bug #238)

2011-01-20 Rudolf Hornig

	* In graphical editor the previous action used with double click (go to
	type or supertype) has ben moved to the F3 key. It is also available
	from the context menu.

2011-01-20 Andras Varga

	* Added a brand new Property dialog that can be accessed by double clicking
	on the module or type. Type, name, vector size and graphical properties

	supports inner types and packages

2011-01-07 Rudolf Hornig

	* NED Editor now supports drag-and-drop operations of inner types (moving
	an inner type to top level, or the other way around). Types dropped inside
	the submodule area create a submodule with that type. Types dropped on the
	title area of the compound module create an inner type.

2011-01-06 Andras Varga

	* Unit name now can be set in property editor for compound modules

2011-01-04 Andras Varga

	* Compound module border now can be set to 0 width

2011-01-04 Rudolf Hornig

	* In the graphical editor, inner types can now be created by dropping
	a NED type on the title of the compound module

2011-01-03 Rudolf Hornig

	command line displayed in the console when the process start has
	failed is much more readable now.

2010-12-22 Rudolf Hornig

	* Property cell editors for type, liketype, extends properties on simple
	modules, compound modules, channels, submodules and connections are now
	displaying all the possible types correctly. Cells contents are validated
	so nonexistent types cannot be used.

2010-12-17 Rudolf Hornig

	* Fixed #230. The values for Type, Like and Extends property on a
	submodule/connections/or NED type (top-level or inner) are initialized
	correctly. They contain correct values according to the current lookup context.

	* Cloning or creating new inner types using the graphical editor now
	generates unique names correctly

2010-12-16 Rudolf Hornig

	* Changed the palette entry ordering in NED editor to include inner types
	in the current file on the top.

2010-12-15 Rudolf Hornig

	* Fixed #229. In NED Editor: Inherited display property values can be
	leared now using "-" as a value. It is possible now to remove an icon
	even if the ancestor specified one.

2010-12-14 Rudolf Hornig

	* Fixed the tooltip of the "Display property" in the properties view. No longer displays null[0]

2010-12-13 Rudolf Hornig

	* Fixed bug#224. NPEs when cloning submodules with connections which are defined in an ancestor module.
	* Fixed bug#227. NPE on upinning a submodule

2010-12-11 Rudolf Hornig

	* Added plugin customization to force workspace refresh on IDE startup.

2010-12-11 Rudolf Hornig

	* Fixed bug#213. NPE occurred in NedEditorLauncher if the filesystem and the
	workspace got out of sync.

2010-12-11 Andras Varga

	* IDE: fix of bug #145: Open NED Type dialog comes up empty on first invocation
	NedTypeSelectionDialog now contains a INedChangeListener, and any NED
	change triggers a delayed update of the displayed list.

	* IDE: fix for bug #223: bogus "X seems to be a hand-written makefile" message
	when the makefile was deleted from the disk behind the IDE's back

2010-12-10 Rudolf Hornig

	* Changed the default OMNeT++ source code formatter profile to match the
	current INET coding convention. Profile is using only spaces instead of
	tabs for indentation.

2010-12-10 Andras Varga

	* IDE: fix for bug #222: Chinese comments become gibberish in NED files.
	Solution: wherever possible, save files in the file's own encoding
	(i.e. charset), using content.getBytes(ifile.getCharset()).

2010-12-06 Rudolf Hornig

	* IDE: Added a "Clean Selected Projects" menuitem to the project explorer context menu.
	This item DOES NOT clean referred projects.

2010-11-10 Rudolf Hornig

	* Support for Profiling (in addition to Debug and Run modes). (enable to use linuxtools with valgrind)

2010-10-19 Rudolf Hornig

	* MachO64 parser support added for new CDT projects. Updated error parsers provided by CDT 7.x.

2010-09-30 Rudolf Hornig

	* Updated the base system to Eclipse 3.6.1

2010-09-22 Andras Varga

	* IDE: fixed resolution of parametric submodule types in NedTreeTraversal

	* IDE: refined the resolution of parametric submodule types
	The actual type needs to be resolved in the project of the inifile,
	not in the project of the compound module that contains the submodule
	(for example, udpApp's type need not be in StandardHost's project INET,
	it may also come from a project that has INET as dependency)

2010-07-13 Tamas Borbely

	* Scave: Line type on vector chart did get reflected in the Chart Properties
	dialog (issue 182). When the line property has the same value for each
	selected line in the Properties dialog, then that value is displayed in
	the control, instead of 'No change'.

	* Scave: Empty chart if refreshing a temp chart after re-running simulation
	(issue 186). When creating a temp chart, runs was identified by runname,
	now they are identified by file/configname/runnumber.  'Add Selected Data
	to Dataset' and 'Convert to Dataset' actions also use the file/configname/
	runnumber fields for consistency.

2010-07-19 Levente Meszaros

	* SeqChart: Fixed a NPE.

	* SeqChart: fix handling show/hide [self] message reuses toggle buttons
	There was some confusion between those buttons, now they toggle showing/hidign
	only for those arrows that they represent.

	* SeqChart: fix message reuse arrows when affected by a module method call
	The end point for a message reuse was wrong. It used the event's module of
	the begin send entry instead of the context module to determine the Y coordinate.

2010-07-13 Tamas Borbely

	* fix issue 180: fixed assert when double coordinate is +-Infinite

	* fix issue 196: use file/configname/runnumber to identify runs of temp chart data

2010-07-13 Tamas Borbely

	* BaseLineChartEditForm: fix issue 182
	When the line property has the same value for each selected line,
	then that value is displayed in the control instead of 'No change'.

2010-07-12 Tamas Borbely

	* small layout fix in BaseLineChartEditForm

2010-07-08 Andras Varga

	* Scave: fix focus problems (bug #188) by using the new FocusManager class

2010-07-07 Andras Varga

	* Scave: drawing timeouts come now from preferences

	* Scave: time limit facility for line chart plotting

	* Scave: removed smartMode in LinePlot as it was responsible for bug #181
	Turning off symbols for DOTS line type resulted in empty chart.
	http://dev.omnetpp.org/bugs/view.php?id=181

	* SeqChart: axis ordering dialog layout improved: buttons move to the right

	* SeqChart: fix: "Show self-messages" button (blue arched arrow) also toggled
	self-reuse (green) arrows on the chart

2010-06-23 Levente Meszaros

	* Sequence Chart: Fix for find text bug. Find text did not work in filtered eventlogs.

	* Cleanup the show/hide flags related to message send/reuse arrows.
	A couple of renames and minor tweaks, namely arrows are categorized along
	two axes: reuse/send, self/other.

2010-06-22 Andras Varga

	* Scave: fix unreadable (black-on-black) filter combo dropdown on ubuntu 10.04
	in Ubuntu 10.04: in the default theme, combo editfield is black-on-white
	and dropdown list is white-on-black, so calling setForeground() on the combo
	will inevitably make one of them unreadable. Workaround: do NOT call
	getForeground().

2010-06-11  ------ omnetpp-4.1 released ------

2010-05-31  ------ omnetpp-4.1rc2 released ------

2010-04-20  ------ omnetpp-4.1b4 released ------

2009-08-03  Levente Meszaros

	* Connection chooser brings up channel chooser when using the default
	connection tool and there are matching labels between the connected
	gates and an available channel type.

	* Palette shows NED types in two distinct groups: the first contains
	those which are related to the current editor ordered by score, the
	second contains all available types ordered by name

2009-07-17  Levente Meszaros

	* Text editor provides new context menu items to infer/distribute gate labels.

2009-07-15  Levente Meszaros

	* Palette provides regexp based substring filtering for qualified NED
	type names and @label properties.

	* Palette sorts submodules based on what is actually already used, what
	could be connected and @contains properties.

2009-07-14  Levente Meszaros

	* Added support for matching @labels properties of gates in the connection
	chooser popup menu.

2009-07-13  Levente Meszaros

	* Added validation to parameters dialog, reserved NED words cannot be
	parameter names, and parameter values must be valid expressions.

2009-06-09  Levente Meszaros

	* SEQCHART: Added sequence chart support to display module method calls
	as vertical orange arrows. The arrow's label is the method's name,
	tooltips are also available.

	* Some message send arrows were drawn incorrectly from the caller module
	due to not taking into consideration module method calls. From now on
	these kind of arrows might start from any point on a module's axis,
	even if there was no event at that simulation time in the callee module.

	* Store various show/hide flags in sequence chart eventlog configuration files.
