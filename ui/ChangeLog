   * Before running the simulations, the IDE will show the command line in
     the console view to help you execute the same simulation from the
     command line.

   * CTRL-TAB now works on freshly opened NED files even if you do not explicitly
     select a simple module. In this case the IDE opens the .h and .cc files
     associated with the first simple module in the NED file.

2011-05-05  ------ omnetpp-4.2b2 released ------

     around 10.000 submodules.

   * Performance: NED validation is done now in a background thread

2011-02-03 Rudolf Hornig

   * Graphical editor: Figure borders and outlines now correctly follow the zoom level.

   * Graphical editor: The resize/move feedback figures have been changed to transparent blue from a simple outline.

2011-02-03 Levente Meszaros

   * Added Technology Preview version of the network animator. It works only on .elog files smaller than
     10Mb. You can open it by right clicking on an .elog file and selection "Open width...".
     This implementation is NOT optimized for larger files.

2011-02-01 Rudolf Hornig

   * NED Files are refreshed now before opening. No more file is out of sync messages if the opened
     ned file was modified outside of the IDE.

2011-02-01 Andras Varga

   * Simulation launcher: Size of the popup information tooltip is limited when displaying all the runs.
     (i.e. whan the parameter space is too big)

2011-01-31 Levente Meszaros

   * Added the possibility to go to a specific simulation time in event log view by specifying
     relative values (+-) in the dialog (units are supported)

   * In sequence chart added 'Goto simulation time' and 'Goto event number' in the context menu

   * Sequence chart: the current position is shown in the gutter

2011-01-24 Rudolf Hornig

   * Context menu in graphical editor is reorganized for better and easier access of the
     most used functions.

   * Linux tools now included in the build. It allows to profile the simulation using VALGRIND
     on LINUX systems. (Windows and Mac builds does not have this capability). Use the "Profile as"
     menu item in the context menu of the project directory.

2011-01-21 Rudolf Hornig

   * Go to C++ definiton (CTRL-TAB) now correctly finds the appropriate C++ class even if the
     NED type is extending and other type or it is using the @class property. (bug #238)

2011-01-20 Rudolf Hornig

   * In graphical editor the previous action used with double click (go to type or supertype)
     has ben moved to the F3 key. It is also available from the conetxt menu.

2011-01-20 Andras Varga

   * Added a brand new Property dialog that can be accessed by double clicking on the module or type.
     Type, name, vector size and graphical properties are supported. A preview is shown at the bottom
     of the dialog.

   * Enhanced Ned Type Selection dialog (CTRL-SHIFT-N)

2011-01-18 Rudolf Hornig

2011-01-07 Rudolf Hornig

   * NED Editor now suppoerts the drag and drop operations of inner types (move an inner type to top level
     or the other way around). Types droppend inside the submodule area create a submodule with that type.
     Types dropped on the title area of the compound module create an inner type.

2011-01-06 Andras Varga

   * Unit name now can be set in property editor for compound modules

2011-01-04 Andras Varga

   * Compound module border now can be set to 0 width

2011-01-04 Rudolf Hornig

   * In graphical editor inner types can be created by dropping a NED Type on the title of the compound module

2011-01-03 Rudolf Hornig

   * The simulation process is now started by using relative paths. The command line displayed in the console
   when the process start has failed is much readeble now.

2010-12-22 Rudolf Hornig

   * Property cell editors for type, liketype, extends properties on simple modules, compound modules, channels
   submodules and connections are now displaying all the possible types correctly. Cells contents are validated
   so no-existent types cannot be used.

2010-12-17 Rudolf Hornig

   * Fixed #230. The values for Type, Like and Extends property on a submodule/connections/or ned type (top-level or inner) 
   are initialized correctly. They contain correct values according to the current lookup context.

   * Cloning or creating new inner types using the graphical editor now generates unique names correctly

2010-12-16 Rudolf Hornig

   * Changed the palette entry ordering in NED editor to include inner types in the current file on the top.

2010-12-13 Rudolf Hornig

   * Fixed bug#224. NPEs when cloning submodules with connections which are defined in an ancestor module.
   * Fixed bug#227. NPE on upinning a submodule

2010-12-11 Rudolf Hornig 

    * Added plugin customization to force workspace refresh on IDE startup.

2010-12-11 Rudolf Hornig 

    * Fixed bug#213. NPE occurred in NedEditorLauncher if the filesystem and the workspace got out of sync.

2010-12-11 Andras Varga 

    * IDE: fix of bug #145: Open NED Type dialog comes up empty on first invocation
    NedTypeSelectionDialog now contains a INedChangeListener, and any NED
    change triggers a delayed update of the displayed list.

    * IDE: fix for bug #223: bogus "X seems to be a hand-written makefile" message
    when the makefile was deleted from the disk behind the IDE's back

2010-12-10 Rudolf Hornig 

    * Changed the default OMNeT++ source code formatter profile to match the current INET coding convention.
    Profile is using only spaces instead of tabs for indentation.

2010-12-10 Andras Varga 

    * IDE: fix for bug #222: Chinese comments become gibberish in NED files.
    Solution: wherever possible, save files in the file's own encoding
    (i.e. charset), using content.getBytes(ifile.getCharset()).

2010-12-06 Rudolf Hornig 

    * IDE: Added a "Clean Selected Projects" menuitem to the project explorer context menu. 
    This item DOES NOT clean referred projects.

2010-11-10 Rudolf Hornig 

    * Support for Profiling (in addition to Debug and Run modes). (enable to use linuxtools with valgrind)

2010-10-19 Rudolf Hornig 

    * MachO64 parser support added for new CDT projects. Updated error parsers provided by CDT 7.x.

    * Updated the base system to Eclipse 3.6.1

2010-09-22 Andras Varga 

    * IDE: fixed resolution of parametric submodule types in NedTreeTraversal

    * IDE: refined the resolution of parametric submodule types
    The actual type needs to be resolved in the project of the inifile,
    not in the project of the compound module that contains the submodule
    (for example, udpApp's type need not be in StandardHost's project INET,
    it may also come from a project that has INET as dependency)

2010-07-13 Tamas Borbely

   * Scave: Line type on vector chart did get reflected in the Chart Properties dialog (issue 182).
   When the line property has the same value for each selected line in the Properties dialog,
   then that value is displayed in the control, instead of 'No change'.

   * Scave: Empty chart if refreshing a temp chart after re-running simulation (issue 186).
   When creating a temp chart, runs was identified by runname, now they are identified
   by file/configname/runnumber. 'Add Selected Data to Dataset' and 'Convert to Dataset'
   actions also use the file/configname/runnumber fields for consistency.

2010-07-19 Levente Meszaros 

    * SeqChart: Fixed a NPE.

    * SeqChart: fix handling show/hide [self] message reuses toggle buttons
    There was some confusion between those buttons, now they toggle showing/hidign
    only for those arrows that they represent.

    * SeqChart: fix message reuse arrows when affected by a module method call
    The end point for a message reuse was wrong. It used the event's module of
    the begin send entry instead of the context module to determine the Y coordinate.

2010-07-13 Tamas Borbely

    * fix issue 180: fixed assert when double coordinate is +-Infinite

    * fix issue 196: use file/configname/runnumber to identify runs of temp chart data

2010-07-13 Tamas Borbely

    * BaseLineChartEditForm: fix issue 182
    When the line property has the same value for each selected line,
    then that value is displayed in the control instead of 'No change'.

2010-07-12 Tamas Borbely

    * small layout fix in BaseLineChartEditForm

2010-07-08 Andras Varga 

    * Scave: fix focus problems (bug #188) by using the new FocusManager class

2010-07-07 Andras Varga 

    * Scave: drawing timeouts come now from preferences

    * Scave: time limit facility for line chart plotting

    * Scave: removed smartMode in LinePlot as it was responsible for bug #181
    Turning off symbols for DOTS line type resulted in empty chart.
    http://dev.omnetpp.org/bugs/view.php?id=181

    * SeqChart: axis ordering dialog layout improved: buttons move to the right

    * SeqChart: fix: "Show self-messages" button (blue arched arrow) also toggled 
    self-reuse (green) arrows on the chart

2010-06-23 Levente Meszaros 

    * Sequence Chart: Fix for find text bug. Find text did not work in filtered eventlogs.

    * Cleanup the show/hide flags related to message send/reuse arrows.
    A couple of renames and minor tweaks, namely arrows are categorized along
    two axes: reuse/send, self/other.

2010-06-22 Andras Varga 

    * Scave: fix unreadable (black-on-black) filter combo dropdown on ubuntu 10.04
    in Ubuntu 10.04: in the default theme, combo editfield is black-on-white
    and dropdown list is white-on-black, so calling setForeground() on the combo
    will inevitably make one of them unreadable. Workaround: do NOT call
    getForeground().

    * Connection chooser brings up channel chooser when using the default connection tool and there are matching labels between the connected gates and an available channel type.
    * Palette shows NED types in two distinct groups: the first contains those which are related to the current editor ordered by score, the second contains all available types ordered by name

2009-07-17  Levente Meszaros

    * Text editor provides new context menu items to infer/distribute gate labels.

2009-07-15  Levente Meszaros

    * Palette provides regexp based substring filtering for qualified NED type names and @label properties.
    * Palette sorts submodules based on what is actually already used, what could be connected and @contains properties.

2009-07-14  Levente Meszaros

    * Added support for matching @labels properties of gates in the connection chooser popup menu.

2009-07-13  Levente Meszaros

    * Added validation to parameters dialog, reserved NED words cannot be parameter names, and parameter values must be valid expressions.

2009-06-09  Levente Meszaros

    * SEQCHART: Added sequence chart support to display module method calls as vertical orange arrows.
    The arrow's label is the method's name, tooltips are also available.

    * Some message send arrows were drawn incorrectly from the caller module due to not taking
    into consideration module method calls. From now on these kind of arrows might start from
    any point on a module's axis, even if there was no event at that simulation time in the
    callee module.

    * Store various show/hide flags in sequence chart eventlog configuration files.
