Sequence Chart
==============

Features:
 + display content according to simulation log file or in memory filter
 + timeline mode:
   + linear
   + step
   + non-linear
   + parameterized non-linear
 - sort axis by:
   + user specified manual order
   + module id
   + module name
   + minimizing axis crossing message sends
   - minimizing axis crossing message sends hierarchically (place sibling modules next to each other)
 - zoom:
   + zoom in and out by clicking on the buttons
   + zoom in and out by + and - keys
   + mark zoom area with control and left drag
   - zoom to fit whole file in current window (small files only)
   - zoom to normal detail level
 + flags turned on and off:
   + display event numbers
   + display message names
   + display arrow heads
   - display axis names
   - display simulation time gutter
   - display info
   - display zero simulation time ranges
 + display simulation time for horizontal mouse position on the gutter
 + show multiple tooltip information:
   + event information
   + message send information
   + axis information
 + in memory filtering based on:
   + simple modules selected from the module tree
   + trace selected event
 + increase and decrease spacing between axis
 + mouse wheel
   + scrolls up and down among axis
   + holding control increases and decreases zoom level
   + holding shift scrolls horizontally
 + context menu:
   + axis
     + split space among axis evenly
     + make axis dense
     + center axis
     + fit axis state value to window
   + event
     + center on window
     + trace
   + message send 
     + fit to window
     + go to source
     + go to target
 + navigation history
 + single click goes in the corresponding event log table to the selected event
 + double click traces the selected event and switches to filtered view
 + toggle bookmark on selected event
 + switch back to unfiltered view
 + support attaching and detaching a vector from a vector file to be displayed on the axis
 - display a separator where the timeline is filtered (timeline is not linear to pixel coordinates not even on the small scale)
 + make sequence chart horizontal scrollbar virtual (can't tell the exact size of the canvas)
 + scrolling with the horizontal scroll bar arrows and click near the thumb
 - write key frames during simulation to avoid linear search for reusing messages
 + toolbar icons
 + setup mouse gestures for easy navigation along the message dependencies
 + follow log file changes
 + event numbers on the bottom axis are not visible when axes are balanced
 + SVG export
 + store and restore last known settings and position per file
 + timeout support
 - message reuse lookahead setting

Known bugs:
 - hierarchical sorting sequence chart axes based on crossing arrows is broken
 - tracing events sometimes kills eclipse
