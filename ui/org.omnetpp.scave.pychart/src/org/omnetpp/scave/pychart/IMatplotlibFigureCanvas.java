/**
 * This is an interface to the Python half our custom matplotlib FigureCanvas.
 *
 * The SWT Canvas (MatplotlibWidget) passes the input events back to matplotlib
 * through this interface.
 *
 * Performing actions (as described by ActionDescription - tool selection and
 * nacigation history: zoom, pan, back, forward, home, etc.); exporting the
 * figure (by matplotlib, in any format supported by it); querying the supported
 * export file formats (png, svg, ps, etc.); and querying and restoring the axis
 * limits (to keep the navigation state the same across subsequent script
 * executions); also happens through this interface.
