2022-05-18  Andras Varga

	* Fix #705: Configuration option "cmdenv-config-name" is ignored

2022-05-18  Attila Torok

	* build: Disable implicit make rules by setting .SUFFIXES to empty

2022-04-11  ------ omnetpp-6.0 released ------

2022-04-06  Andras Varga

	* Working around compiler bug on macOS.

2021-12-17  Andras Varga

	* Wording of an error message refined

2021-06-09  Attila Torok

	* Add cEnvir::pausePoint() and stubs

2021-08-05  Attila Torok

	* Cmdenv::componentInitBegin(): call base class method, as it is no longer empty

2021-05-13  Andras Varga

	* Cosmetics on '// namespace' comments

2021-05-12  Attila Torok

	* Added cmdenv-fake-gui-seed config option

2021-03-21  Andras Varga

	* Refactoring: factor out some repeated code.

2020-11-09  Andras Varga

	* Fake GUI: change the way it is configured. The set of currently
	supported options: cmdenv-fake-gui-before-event-probability,
	cmdenv-fake-gui-after-event-probability, cmdenv-fake-gui-on-hold-probability,
	cmdenv-fake-gui-on-hold-numsteps, cmdenv-fake-gui-on-simtime-probability,
	cmdenv-fake-gui-on-simtime-numsteps

2020-11-13  Attila Torok

	* Modernizing: Use in-class member initializers wherever possible;
	use "=default" syntax for copy constructors where appropriate.
	Tool: clang-tidy plus manual editing where needed.

2019-07-24  Andras Varga

	* Print a warning that Fake GUI is an experimental feature.

2019-07-11  Andras Varga

	* Added cmdenv-fake-gui=true/false option. Fake GUI means that
	refreshDisplay() is called periodically during simulation, in order to mimic
	the behavior of a graphical user interface like Qtenv. It is useful for
	testing simulation models with visualization using Cmdenv, e.g. in smoke or
	fingerprint tests.

2019-07-11  Andras Varga

	* Micro-optimization: Spare repeated getSimulation() calls in the event loop

2019-07-11  Andras Varga

	* Cosmetics: Changed config option constants to match option names (added
	"CMDENV_" to them)

2019-07-02  Attila Torok

	* Nicer error message about missing network= option

2019-01-30  Andras Varga

	* Follow EnvirBase changes: startRun() renamed, endRun() eliminated.

2019-01-16  Rudolf Hornig

	* Makefile refinements

	* Follow recent histogram API changes

2017-12-15  Attila Torok

	* Follow cEnvir change: Add dummy implementation for getZoomLevel()

2017-01-16  Andras Varga

	* Replace gettimeofday() occurrences with opp_get_monotonic_clock_usecs(),
	and struct timeval with plain int64_t.

2017-12-08  ------ omnetpp-5.2.1 released ------

2017-10-16  Attila Torok

	* Fix: Prevent a division by zero causing a buffer overflow.

	If the simtimeLimit was set to zero (--sim-time-limit=0s), 'simtimeRatio'
	became NaN as a result of the division by zero. NaN was cast to int,
	yielding a very large negative number (-2147483648). The final effect
	was that we printed 47 bytes into a 32 byte long buffer.

2017-09-18  ------ omnetpp-5.2 released ------

2017-04-06  Andras Varga

	* Modernizing: use C++11's range-based for loops where applicable, using
	clang-tidy's modernize-loop-convert.

	* Modernizing: replace INT64_PRINTF_FORMAT and LL with C++11's PRId64.
	Note: PRId64 includes the "d" that was not part of INT64_PRINTF_FORMAT
	alias LL.

2017-05-25  Rudolf Hornig

	* Updated makefiles for speeding up the build:
	- generated files are created only once, even when using parallel build
	- binaries are copied to their final destination using proper makefile
	  targets

2017-05-12  Rudolf Hornig

	* Added (% total) to the event banner. The event banner now display
	progress both in terms of % of the run and % of the total batch.
	The two are different if several runs are executed in the same process.

2016-12-19  Andras Varga

	* Completion percentage computation updated: take real-time-limit into
	account.

2016-11-30  Rudolf Hornig

	* build: Makefile refactored. Added clang-c2 support and optimized
	the build process.

	* build: removed Makefile.vc, as Visual C++ builds are now handled
	by the standard Makefiles.

2016-11-21  Andras Varga

	* Follow change: sim-time-limit=0s and cpu-time-limit=0s now take effect

2016-11-18  Andras Varga

	* Added the cmdenv-stop-batch-on-error=<bool> option. It defaults
	to true.

	* cmdenv-interactive can now be specified on per-run basis.

	* Refined printing of run statistics at the end. Example output:
	'Run statistics: total 42, successful 30, errors 1, skipped 11'

2016-11-18  Andras Varga

	* Follow cEnvir API change: added appendToImagePath(), loadImage(),
	getSubmodulePosition() as no-ops.

2016-11-10  Andras Varga

	* Standardized error messages: Start with uppercase letter, use
	'apostrophe quoting' instead of `mixed quoting', etc.

2016-10-27  Andras Varga

	* Follow cEnvir API change regarding getImageSize()/getTextExtent()

2016-10-19  Andras Varga

	* Follow cEnvir API change regarding askyesno(), putmsg(), alert() etc.

	* Standardised printing of error messages (err()/warn())

2016-10-05  Andras Varga

	* Internals: use C++-style I/O for all logging

2016-10-03  Andras Varga

	* Output: Implemented the -s (silent, i.e. non-verbose) command-line
	option.

2016-09-29  Andras Varga

	* Output: cmdenv-output-file option can now be specificied per run,
	and it defaults to a file name similar to result files (in the results/
	directory etc, but with the .out extension.) Since saving the output
	can no longer be disabled by omitting the cmdenv-output-file setting,
	it can now be controlled with the new cmdenv-redirect-output=<bool>.

2016-08-08  Andras Varga

	* Follow cEnvir API change: added getAnimationTime(), getAnimationSpeed(),
	getRemainingAnimationHoldTime()) as no-ops.

2016-09-25  Andras Varga

	* Run filtering: The -r option and cmdenv-runs-to-execute= now also
	accept a run filter expression as an altenative to a list of run
	numbers and run number ranges. Use -q to query the list of matching
	runs.

	Example: -c Aloha -r '$numHosts>20 and $numHosts<=100' -q runconfig

2016-11-30  Rudolf Hornig

	* The updated build system now uses the ./configure file only to detect
	certain flags and libraries. Most of the build logic is handled by the
	Makefile.inc file itslef. This allows you to enable/disable optional
	components (i.e. Tkenv,Qtenv,OSG and osgEarth support) without even
	re-running the ./configure file.

2016-08-31  Andras Varga

	* Print summary at the end when doing multiple runs:
	"Done %d simulation runs, %d successful, %d errors"

2016-07-21  Attila Torok

	* Follow cEnvir API change: added getImageSize(), getTextExtent() as no-ops

2016-06-23  Rudolf Hornig

	* The makefile now uses compiler-generated dependency files.

2016-04-13  ------ omnetpp-5.0 released ------

2016-03-31  Levente Meszaros

	* Refined markup in config option descriptions.

2016-03-23  Zoltan Bojthe

	* Added markup to config option descriptions.

2016-03-10  ------ omnetpp-5.0rc released ------

2016-03-10  Levente Meszaros

	* cmdenv-log-format option renamed to cmdenv-log-prefix.

2016-03-09  Rudolf Hornig

	* Change in event bannner format (display "T=<time>" with lowercase t).

2016-02-22  Levente Meszaros & Andras Varga

	* With the recent simulation kernel changes, printEventBanner() needs to be
	called inside simulationEvent() so that it prints the correct (updated)
	simulation time and event number.

2016-02-15  Levente Meszaros

	* Removed the cmdenv-global-log-level configuration option. It was
	confusing due to being redundant with the per-component configuration
	option. The equivalent is the **.cmdenv-log-level configuration option, it
	should be used instead.

2016-02-08  Levente Meszaros

	* Fixed isExpressMode() to actually return true in express mode.
	* Changed Cmdenv::log() to write to stdout whenever its called. Added a
	check for blank log prefix for performance reasons.
	* Removed the per-component cmdenv-ev-output configuration option. It's
	superseded by per-component cmdenv-log-level configuration option.
	* Removed the cmdenv-module-messages configuration option. It's superseded
	by **.cmdenv-log-level = OFF configuration option.
	* Removed the cmdenv-message-trace configuration option. It had very
	limited usefulness, and it was somewhat overlapping with eventlog.

2016-02-05  Andras Varga

	* Moved per-component log level from sim to cmdenv.

2015-12-07  ------ omnetpp-5.0b3 released ------

2015-10-16  Andras Varga

	* omnetpp namespace made permanent (cannot be turned off):
	- removed configure option and preprocessor symbol USE_NAMESPACE
	- removed related macros: NAMESPACE_BEGIN, NAMESPACE_END,
	  USING_NAMESPACE, OPP, OPP_STR, OPP_PREFIX etc.

2015-07-20  ------ omnetpp-5.0b2 released ------

2015-06-16  Andras Varga

	* Cleanup: prefer ++it to it++ (less copying)

2015-06-08  Andras Varga

	* Cleanup: longer header guards

2015-06-08  Andras Varga

	* Cleanup: code formatting

2015-05-15  Andras Varga

	* Cleanup: use per-folder nested namespaces: omnetpp::envir, omnetpp::tkenv,
	omnetpp::layout, omnetpp::common, omnetpp::eventlog, etc.

2015-05-22  Andras Varga

	* Modernizing: added the 'override' keyword (C++11) to overridden methods;
	it becomes blank when using with an older compiler.

2015-05-21  Rudolf Hornig

	* Modernizing: replaced NULLs by 'nullptr' (C++11); it is defined as 0
	when using an older compiler.

2015-05-11  Andras Varga

	* Cleanup: data members renamed to camelCase

2015-04-20  Andras Varga

	* Cleanup: use C++ names of C headers (e.g. <cstdio> instead of <stdio.h>)

2015-04-14  Andras Varga

	* Occurrences of the "simulation" macro replaced by getSimulation() calls

2015-04-12  Andras Varga

	* Cleanup: copyright years updated

2015-04-08  Andras Varga

	* Modernizing:

	- Use a fixed include path (-Iinclude -Isrc) for all source folders
	  under src/, and qualify cross-folder #includes with the folder
	  name (e.g. change #include "stringutil.h" to #include "common/stringutil.h").
	  This increases readbility and reduces the chance of including a wrong
	  header.

	- In source files, sort #include statements by folder.

2015-03-04  ------ omnetpp-5.0b1 released ------

2013-09-26  Andras Varga

	* Follow logging API changes (sputn() replaced by log() function); see
	see related ChangeLog entry in envir/

	* New configuration options, to control the format of the log prefix
	(with % tags, e.g. %l stands for log level), and the detail level of
	logging (INFO, DEBUG, TRACE, etc):
	  - cmdenv-log-format=<string>, default: "[%l]\t"
	  - cmdenv-log-level=<string>, default: "DEBUG"

2013-01-28  Andras Varga

	initialization

2010-03-14  ------ omnetpp-4.1b3 released ------

2009-09-10  Andras Varga

	* fix: cmdenv.cc: opt_autoflush was used before getting initialized
	[from Thomas Dreibholz]

2009-07-07  Andras Varga

	* fix: there was no error message if a nonexistent configuration name
	was given via -c or cmdenv-config-name.

2009-02-27  ------ omnetpp-4.0rc2 released ------

2008-12-14  Andras Varga

	in them

2008-12-12  ------ omnetpp-4.0rc1 released ------

2008-12-10  Andras Varga

	* express mode status updates are now always flushed (no need to set
	cmdenv-autoflush)

	* cmdenv-status-frequency is now interpreted in seconds (default
	is every 2 seconds)

	* express mode: when simulation stops (on Ctrl+C, exception, normally,
	etc), Cmdenv prints a final status update

2008-11-26  Andras Varga

	* library renamed to oppcmdenv

2008-06-19  Andras Varga

	* refined signal handling: only turn on special signal handling while
	the simulation is processing events. During lengthy initializations
	etc, one can still abort the program via Ctrl-C. SIGTERM and SIGINT
	are handled. [suggested by Bradley Settlemyer]

2008-02-23  Andras Varga

	Summary of changes for omnetpp-4.0 (2006..2008):

	* inifile syntax change: [Cmdenv] config entries became cmdenv-... ones

	* cmdenv-express-mode= now defaults to true

	* new inifile entry: cmdenv-interactive=. When false, Cmdenv will
	never read stdin, which is better suited for batch execution.

	* -c option and cmdenv-config-name= inifile entry for specifying the
	configuration name to run; specific runs for the configuration can
	be selected with existing -r option or cmdenv-runs-to-execute=.
	For example,  "-c Foo -r 1..5" does 5 runs from [Config Foo]
	in the ini file.

	* prints progress percentages "nn% completed" during simulation.
	It is used by the simulation launcher's progress bar in the IDE.
	The algorithm computes percentage both from sim-time-limit and
	cpu-time-limit, and prints the larger one.

	* for run iterations (-r option and cmdenv-runs-to-execute=), accept
	both ".." and "-" as range separator, i.e. both  "2..5" and "2-5" are
	valid

	* from now on, you need to specify "-u _cmdenv_lib" (gcc) or
	"/include:_cmdenv_lib" (vc++) in addition to -lcmdenv (or cmdenv.lib)
	on the linker command line. But: now you can have a program with both
	Cmdenv and Tkenv in it.

	* out-of-directory build, and other Makefile changes

	* obsolete source heap.cc removed

	* SEE CHANGES FOR ENVIR TOO. (Envir is the common part of Cmdenv and
	Tkenv).

2005-03-22  Andras Varga

	* cmdenv.cc/h: handling of -h option moved into TOmnetApp base class.

2005-03-02  Andras Varga

	* cmdenv.h/cc: makeOptionsEffective() merged into readPerRunOptions()

2005-01-10  Andras Varga

2004-11-03  ------ omnetpp-3.0a9 released ------

2004-10-27  Andras Varga

	* cmdenv.cc: minor ajustment: makeOptionsEffective() should be called
	right after readPerRunOptions()

2004-10-25  Andras Varga

	* cmdenv.cc: updated for info() and fullPath() signature changes
	(see include/ChangeLog)

2004-10-04  ------ omnetpp-3.0a8 released ------

2004-09-24  ------ omnetpp-3.0a7 released ------

2004-07-22  ------ omnetpp-3.0a6 released ------

2004-07-10  Andras Varga

	* cmdenv.cc/h: now it's possible to control which modules' ev<< output
	Cmdenv prints when run with express-mode=false and module-messages=
	true. The configuration is: [Cmdenv]/<modulepath>.ev-output=true/false.
	An example which enables only output from modules named "tcpdump":
	  [Cmdenv]
	  module-messages=true
	  **.tcpdump.ev-output=true
	  **.ev-output=false
	ev<< in finish() is always fully printed.

2004-07-06  Andras Varga

	* cmdenv.cc: fixed Speedometer usage; added milliseconds to elapsed
	time. FIXME calculated + speedometer values don't correspond because
	the two call ftime() independently

2004-06-07  ------ omnetpp-3.0a5 released ------

2004-05-15  ------ omnetpp-3.0a4 released ------

2004-03-22  ------ omnetpp-3.0a3 released ------

2004-03-03  ------ omnetpp-3.0a2 released ------

2004-02-23  Andras Varga

	* cmdenv.cc: new omnetpp.ini option:
	    event-banner-details= true/false (default: false).
	It is in effect with normal mode (express-mode=false), and causes
	elapsed time and number of messages (created,present, in FES) to be
	printed in a second line below the event banner. Format:
	   Elapsed: 131s (2m 11s)  Messages: created: 45 present: 45 in FES: 18
	Also changed the format of elapsed time display in express mode:
	prints it in seconds as well.

2004-02-11  Andras Varga

	* cmdenv.cc: propagated semantic change in getNextEvent()'s and
	selectNextModule()'s return value (see include/ChangeLog)

2004-02-05  Andras Varga

	* heap.cc made disabled by default (and has to be explicitly enabled
	by defining USE_CMDENV_HEAPDEBUG), and changed to throw std::alloc
	on out-of-memory condition.

2004-02-04  ------ omnetpp-3.0pre1 released ------

2004-01-06  Andras Varga

	* cmdenv.h: added isGUI()

2003-12-11  Andras Varga

	* all files: follow changes in sim/; C-style casts replaced with
	static_cast<>

2003-11-13  Andras Varga

	* Checked in parallel simulation code that was developed March-May 2003,
	during my stay at Monash University. Changes:

	2003-04-18  Andras Varga
	* new ini file option:
	  output-file=<filename>
	If present, output will be redirected to the given file. If the
	[General]/fname-append-host setting is turned on, the the host
	name and pid (process id) will be appended to the file name.
	Particularly useful when a parallel simulation is run from a shared
	directory.

2003-10-02  Andras Varga

	* cmdenv.cc/h: added new method cEnvir::moduleMethodCalled()

2003-09-22  Andras Varga

	* cmdenv.cc/h: messageSent() signature change, see include/ChangeLog

2003-06-16  ------ omnetpp-2.3 released ------

2003-03-15  ------ omnetpp-2.3b2 released ------

2003-02-15  ------ omnetpp-2.3b1 released ------

2003-01-07  Andras Varga

	* new ini file options:
	  autoflush=yes/no (default: no)
	    call fflush(stdout) after each event banner or status update;
	    affects both express and normal mode.
	  message-trace=yes/no (default: no)
	    log message sending (by send(),scheduleAt(), etc) and delivery
	    on standard output; effective only in normal mode

	* format of event banner slightly changed

2002-11-03  Andras Varga

	* cmdenv.cc: improved status display

2002-10-20  Andras Varga

	* cmdenv.cc: revised omnetpp.ini entries understood by Cmdenv.
	A new entry was introduced to make it easier to switch between
	typical uses of Cmdenv.
	  express-mode=yes/no (default: no)
	Normal (non-express) mode is for debugging: detailed information
	will be written	to the standard output (event banners, module output,
	etc). Express mode can be used for long simulation runs: only
	periodical status update is displayed about the progress of the
	simulation.
	When in normal (non-express) mode, the following ini file entries
	are taken into account:
	  module-messages=yes/no (default: yes)
	     - printing module ev<< output on/off (as before)
	  event-banners=yes/no (default: yes)
	     - printing event banners on/off; replaces verbose-simulation=
	When in express mode, these entries are used:
	  status-frequency=<integer> (default: 50000)
	     - print status update every n events (on today's computers, and
	     for a typical model, this will produce an update every few seconds,
	     perhaps a few times per second)
	  performance-display=yes/no (default: yes)
	     - print detailed performance status
	Obsoleted entries: display-update=, verbose-simulation=.

2002-10-08  Andras Varga

	* cmdenv.cc: -h command-line option now lists linked-in modules too

2002-10-04  Andras Varga

	* error handling changed from simulation.ok() to exceptions.

2002-05-04  ------ omnetpp-2.2 released ------

2002-01-13  Andras Varga

	* Graceful handling of SIGTERM and SIGINT signals: calls finish()
	for current simulation and exits. Works on Unix only (Win32 doesn't
	support SIGTERM and SIGINT, among others). Based on suggestion and
	patch from Michele Baresi.

2000-06-06  Andras Varga

	* ------ omnetpp-2.1 released ------

	* Borland C++ support removed: I deleted the project files
	(*.ide). I added equivalent Makefile.bc files (generated from the
	BC IDE), but they are completely unsupported at the moment. If
	there's interest, it's possible that later I'll add makefiles for
	the free command-line bc5.5 compiler.

	* ------ omnetpp-2.0p1 released ------

	* ------ omnetpp-2.0 released ------

	* heap.cc, operator new fixed: when out of memory, it doesn't
	return NULL but calls exit(1). (According to the ISO standard, op
	new should throw an exception when out of memory. Unfortunately,
	exceptions are incompatible with the coroutine library's
	setjmp/longjmp magic, so OMNeT++ doesn't use exceptions at all.)

	HEAP.CC TO BE TESTED!!!

2000-05-10  Andras Varga

	* ------ omnetpp-2.0b5 released ------

	* ------ omnetpp-2.0b4 released ------

	* [Cmdenv]/extra-stack= option added, it specifies (in bytes) how
	much extra stack each activity() module needs when executing under
	Cmdenv.  This used to be hardcoded (8192), now users can fine-tune
	it.

2000-05-07  Andras Varga

	   * Makefile.vc improvements from Balazs Kelemen

2000-04-10  Andrea Varga

	* changes to enable linking a Windows DLL from the library

	* memoryIsLow() reorganized; cosmetic changes on heap.cc

	* adjustments because of TOmnetApp constructor changes

	* added cmdenvDummy()/envirDummy(): functions which can/should be
	called from Envir in order to force the linker to include the
	Cmdenv library into the executable. (These functions do absolutely
	nothing.)

	* TRUE/FALSE (defines) replaced by true/false (C++ keywords)

	* in printf() statements, all "%lf","%lg","%le" was replaced by
	"%f","%g","%e"

2000-04-04  Andras Varga

	* dynamic registration of user interface (TOmnetApp) classes
	introduced: Register_OmnetApp() macro added to cmdenv.cc

2000-03-26  Andras Varga

	* 'char *' pointers made const-correct (lots of 'char *' -->
	'const char *' replacements throughout the code)

	* ------ omnetpp-2.0b3 released ------

	* Makefile.vc added

1999-12-04  Andras Varga

1997-07-31  Andras Varga

	* [General]/number-of-runs= ini file option was replaced by

	  [Cmdenv]/runs-to-execute=.
	  Now it's possible to say things like:
	     [Cmdenv]
	     runs-to-execute = 1,2, 5-8
	  There is a command-line equivalent: -r1,2,5-8
	  If the list of runs is not given explicitly, executes all runs
	  that have an ini file section; if no runs are given in the ini file,
	  does one run.
