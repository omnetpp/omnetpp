	* in the layouter external interface (GraphLayouter), changed cModule*
	pointers to int nodeId as a means of identifying nodes, because
	using cModule* was not very convenient with the SWIG JNI wrapper
	(nativelibs library).

	* added BasicGraphLayouterEnvironment, for use from the IDE

	* BasicSpringEmbedderLayout: findNode() is no longer linear search

2011-02-15  Andras Varga

	* In the external interface of layouters (GraphLayouter class),
	changed "int" to "double" for coordinates and distances. Internally
	they all already calculated everything in floating point.

	* Improvements on the "classic" layouting algorithm:

	- Correctly take into account the bounding box of anchored nodes when
	  clipping anchor positions to background boundaries. See new fields
	  x1off, y1off, x2off, y2off fields of Node.

	- Subgraphs that are not connected to any fixed node are now allowed
	  to stretch to negative coordinates during layouting, and will get
	  shifted back to positive coordinates afterwards. This is only done
	  if there is no background size given, otherwise there was no
	  guarantee that the layouted subgraph would fit into the background
	  area. See new field connectedToFixed of Node.

	- Initial random distribution of nodes: area is now basically
	  proportional to the number of nodes (i.e. one side is proportional
	  to the square root of #nodes), instead of being fixed 600x400.
	  We take the union of that area and the area already occupied by
	  fixed nodes, and there is also a minimum size.

	- Fix: addEdge(): module size was taken into account incorrectly

	- Refactoring: bounding box calculation, creating the initial random
	  distribution, etc. factored out to separate methods.

	* Bugfixes and cleanup of "classic" layouting algorithm:
	- fix: dynamically created modules in Tkenv often ended up outside
	  the compound module rectangle (see test/anim/dynamic2 test)
	- initial random placement to use the area already occupied by fixed
	  nodes (but minimum 600x400)
	- removed scalingMode, setConfineToArea(), setScaleToArea(); related
	  functionality is now internal to the layouter class
	- removed several tweaks and nonlinearities from layouting code
	- removed unused CONTRACTING_BOX code
	- renaming of variables ("from"/"to" to "src"/"target", etc)

	* library renamed to opplayout

2008-04-19  Andras Varga

	* basicspringembedderlayout: changed initial rect to 1000x1000 (was 100x100)

2008-02-23  Andras Varga

	* Started the ChangeLog. The Layout library was added in omnetpp-4.0.
	It implements graph layouting algorithms, used for rendering networks
	and compound modules in the IDE (graphical NED editor, NED documentation
	generator), and in the runtime environment (Tkenv). BasicSpringEmbedderLayout
	was taken from 3.x Tkenv; the other, more advanced algorithms were
	implemented by Levente Meszaros.
