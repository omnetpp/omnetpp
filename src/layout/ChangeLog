	* Cosmetics on '// namespace' comments

2020-12-02  Rudolf Hornig

	* Added missing LAYOUT_API macros for proper exporting/visibility of symbols

2020-11-13  Attila Torok

	* Modernizing: Use in-class member initializers wherever possible;
	use "=default" syntax for copy constructors where appropriate.
	Tool: clang-tidy plus manual editing where needed.

	* Fix "Advanced" layouter not doing anything with only anchored
	nodes.

	In one example network, the samples/routing/RandomMesh, there are only
	anchored "nodes" (submodules) - no fixed and no independently movable
	nodes - since the whole network is one matrix with undefined position. In
	this network, when the "Advanced" layouter way selected, none of the
	submodules got a position after layouting. This was most likely never
	tested because the auto selection chooses the simple layouter in this
	simulation.

2017-04-06  Andras Varga

	* Modernizing: use C++11's range-based for loops where applicable, using
	clang-tidy's modernize-loop-convert.

	* Modernizing: replace INT64_PRINTF_FORMAT and LL with C++11's PRId64.
	Note: PRId64 includes the "d" that was not part of INT64_PRINTF_FORMAT
	alias LL.

2017-05-25  Rudolf Hornig

	* Updated makefiles for speeding up the build:
	- generated files are created only once, even when using parallel build
	- binaries are copied to their final destination using proper makefile
	  targets

2017-05-19  Attila Torok

	* Fix memory leak in ForceDirectedGraphLayouter. (Destructor was missing.)

	* build: Makefile refactored. Added clang-c2 support and optimized
	the build process.

	* build: removed Makefile.vc, as Visual C++ builds are now handled
	by the standard Makefiles.

2016-11-29  Attila Torok

	* ForceDirectedGraphLayouter: Layout scaling fix.

	In rare cases, during the prelayouting phase of the advanced layouter,
	when scaling the layout to make it fill the given bounding box, if a node
	had a size equivalent to the bounding box in any dimension, a division by
	zero caused unwanted NaN values, which later triggered the failure of an
	assertion which required the distance between two nodes to be greater
	than zero (but it would be NaN in this case). Discovered by the EnvirApi
	test.

2016-06-23  Rudolf Hornig

	* The makefile now uses compiler-generated dependency files.

2015-10-16  Andras Varga

	* omnetpp namespace made permanent (cannot be turned off):
	- removed configure option and preprocessor symbol USE_NAMESPACE
	- removed related macros: NAMESPACE_BEGIN, NAMESPACE_END,
	  USING_NAMESPACE, OPP, OPP_STR, OPP_PREFIX etc.

2015-07-20  ------ omnetpp-5.0b2 released ------

2015-06-16  Andras Varga

	* Cleanup: prefer ++it to it++ (less copying)

2015-06-08  Andras Varga

	* Cleanup: longer header guards

2015-06-08  Andras Varga

	* Cleanup: code formatting

2015-05-15  Andras Varga

	* Cleanup: use per-folder nested namespaces: omnetpp::envir, omnetpp::tkenv,
	omnetpp::layout, omnetpp::common, omnetpp::eventlog, etc.

2015-05-22  Andras Varga

	* Modernizing: added the 'override' keyword (C++11) to overridden methods;
	it becomes blank when using with an older compiler.

2015-05-21  Rudolf Hornig

	* Modernizing: replaced NULLs by 'nullptr' (C++11); it is defined as 0
	when using an older compiler.

2015-04-20  Andras Varga

	* Cleanup: use C++ names of C headers (e.g. <cstdio> instead of <stdio.h>)

2015-04-12  Andras Varga

	* Cleanup: copyright years updated

2015-04-08  Andras Varga

	* Modernizing:

	- Use a fixed include path (-Iinclude -Isrc) for all source folders
	  under src/, and qualify cross-folder #includes with the folder
	  name (e.g. change #include "stringutil.h" to #include "common/stringutil.h").
	  This increases readbility and reduces the chance of including a wrong
	  header.

	- In source files, sort #include statements by folder.

	* in the layouter external interface (GraphLayouter), changed cModule*
	pointers to int nodeId as a means of identifying nodes, because
	using cModule* was not very convenient with the SWIG JNI wrapper
	(nativelibs library).

	* added BasicGraphLayouterEnvironment, for use from the IDE

	* BasicSpringEmbedderLayout: findNode() is no longer linear search

2011-02-15  Andras Varga

	* In the external interface of layouters (GraphLayouter class),
	changed "int" to "double" for coordinates and distances. Internally
	they all already calculated everything in floating point.

2010-05-15  Andras Varga

	* Improvements on the "classic" layouting algorithm:

	- Correctly take into account the bounding box of anchored nodes when
	  clipping anchor positions to background boundaries. See new fields
	  x1off, y1off, x2off, y2off fields of Node.

	- Subgraphs that are not connected to any fixed node are now allowed
	  to stretch to negative coordinates during layouting, and will get
	  shifted back to positive coordinates afterwards. This is only done
	  if there is no background size given, otherwise there was no
	  guarantee that the layouted subgraph would fit into the background
	  area. See new field connectedToFixed of Node.

	- Initial random distribution of nodes: area is now basically
	  proportional to the number of nodes (i.e. one side is proportional
	  to the square root of #nodes), instead of being fixed 600x400.
	  We take the union of that area and the area already occupied by
	  fixed nodes, and there is also a minimum size.

	- Fix: addEdge(): module size was taken into account incorrectly

	- Refactoring: bounding box calculation, creating the initial random
	  distribution, etc. factored out to separate methods.

2010-04-29  Andras Varga

	* Bugfixes and cleanup of "classic" layouting algorithm:
	- fix: dynamically created modules in Tkenv often ended up outside
	  the compound module rectangle (see test/anim/dynamic2 test)
	- initial random placement to use the area already occupied by fixed
	  nodes (but minimum 600x400)
	- removed scalingMode, setConfineToArea(), setScaleToArea(); related
	  functionality is now internal to the layouter class
	- removed several tweaks and nonlinearities from layouting code
	- removed unused CONTRACTING_BOX code
	- renaming of variables ("from"/"to" to "src"/"target", etc)

	* library renamed to opplayout

2008-04-19  Andras Varga

	* basicspringembedderlayout: changed initial rect to 1000x1000 (was 100x100)

2008-02-23  Andras Varga

	* Started the ChangeLog. The Layout library was added in omnetpp-4.0.
	It implements graph layouting algorithms, used for rendering networks
	and compound modules in the IDE (graphical NED editor, NED documentation
	generator), and in the runtime environment (Tkenv). BasicSpringEmbedderLayout
	was taken from 3.x Tkenv; the other, more advanced algorithms were
	implemented by Levente Meszaros.
