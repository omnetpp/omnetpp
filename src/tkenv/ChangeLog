	* implemented filtering for the timeline

	* implemented scrolback buffer limiting (default is 100,000 lines)

2006-11-12  Andras Varga

	* fix: existing inspector windows didn't come to the front and didn't get
	the focus. This was observed on Kubuntu with kwin 3.0, but maybe
	affected other platforms as well.
	
2006-11-06  Andras Varga

	* enhancement: all non-graphical inspectors replaced with consistent
	treeview-based inspectors

	* enhancement: broadcast animation feature, which is thought to
	significantly improve the animation of wireless simulations (MF!), and 
	generally simulations where broadcast sends occur (e.g. Ethernet).
	When the feature is turned on, then if multiple send() or sendDirect()
	calls occur within a handleMessage(), they are animated	concurrently. 
	This also means that send/sendDirect calls are NOT animated at the 
	place of the call as previously, but together at the end of processing 
	the event (that is, after handleMessage() has already returned). 
	This is done because Tkenv first has to collect all message sendings
	within the event in order to be able to animate them. This out-of-
	sequence animation processing may cause occasional surprise. The 
	broadcast animation feature can be turned off in the Simulation Options 
	dialog.

	* internal refactoring (opp_object_nullpointer renamed to opp_null;
	split animate.tcl and timeline.tcl from modinsp2.tcl, etc)

2006-10-21  ------ omnetpp-3.3 released ------

2006-10-19  Andras Varga

	* modinsp2.tcl: connection arrows with zero thickness ("o=,0") are 
	not drawn.

	* "Save window contents" toolbar icon added to text windows

2006-10-14  Andras Varga

	* several smaller improvements: added object icons to listboxes;
	in the "Find/inspect" dialog one can specify the module in which
	to search; "copy to clipboard" icon added to the main toolbar and
	module log windows, etc

2006-04-13  Andras Varga

	* tkutil.cc: fixed a bug in setObjectListResult() [crash reported by 
	Rodolfo Ribeiro Gomes and others]

2006-03-19  Andras Varga

	* tkapp.cc: use simulation.guessNextSimtime() to display the time of 
	the [probable] next event

2006-01-12  ------ omnetpp-3.2p1 released ------

2005-10-19  ------ omnetpp-3.2 released ------

2005-09-27  Andras Varga

	* statinsp.cc: cOutVector callback method signature change: added
	simtime_t to record_in_insp() arg list.

2005-07-24  Andras Varga

	* tkapp.cc: flush output vector file and output scalar file after
	every event while single-stepping (F4) or when the user stops
	a running simulation (F8). This makes it possible examine a vec
	file with Plove without exiting the simulation program [suggested by
	Michael Tuexen]

2005-07-23  Andras Varga

	* WATCH implementation changed

	* cGate inspector: channel attributes (delay, error and datarate)
	can now be changed from the GUI. [suggested by Michael Tuexen]

2005-07-21  Andras Varga

	to make it more legible (Tk text tag -lmargin2 option)

2005-06-24  Andras Varga

	* modinsp2.tcl: fix: r= display string tag worked incorrectly: circle
	was displayed with radius = r/2 instead of r

2005-05-01  Andras Varga

	* cMessage inspector now displays message size in bytes as well

2005-04-21  Andras Varga

	* added implementation of timeline

2005-03-31  ------ omnetpp-3.1 released ------

2005-03-22  Andras Varga

	* tkapp.cc/h: handling of -h option moved into TOmnetApp base class.

2005-03-19  Andras Varga

	* gate inspector dialog revised (connection display string made 
	editable)

	* modinsp2.tcl, inspector.tcl: implemented new display string
	tag:
	    tt=<tooltip-string>
	It can be used in module, submodule, connection and msg display
	strings, and will cause the given string to appear in a tooltip.

	* modinsp2.tcl: implemented the "t=<string>,<color>" display
	string tag for connections.

	* improvement: queue length display in module graphics now has
	tooltip

	* fix: circle (drawn with "r=" display string tag) was sometimes
	incorrectly positioned

2005-03-17  Andras Varga

	* tkapp.cc: added calls to new scheduler->executionResumed()

2005-03-07  Andras Varga

	* tkapp.cc: added support for -r <run-number> command-line option, 
	which has the same effect as (but takes priority over) [Tkenv]/
	default-run ini file entry.

2005-03-03  Andras Varga

	* structinsp.cc: fix: Tkenv crashed if control info object didn't have
	cStructDescriptor registered [reported by Kurtis Kredo II]

2005-03-02  Andras Varga

	* tkapp.h/cc: makeOptionsEffective() merged into readPerRunOptions()

2005-02-07  Andras Varga

	* enhancement: in omnetpp.ini, description="some text" entries can be 
	added under the [Run 1], [Run 2] etc sections. These descriptions will
	appear in the Tkenv run selection dialog.

2005-02-06  Andras Varga

	* gateinsp.tcl, modinsp.cc: fixed cGate inspector error introduced 
	in 3.0

2005-01-17  Andras Varga

	[suggested by Michael Tuexen]

2005-01-10  Andras Varga

	* tkapp.cc, tkcmd.cc: factored out platform dependencies to 
	include/platdep

2004-12-29  ------ omnetpp-3.0 released ------

2004-12-15  Andras Varga

	* extra-stack= option replaced with extra-stack-kb. Default raised to
	48K (37K stack usage was observed on SUSE 9.1)

2004-12-10  Andras Varga

	* default background color changed from #c0c0c0 to #d0d0d0

	String(); cSimpleChannel renamed to cBasicChannel

2004-11-23  ------ omnetpp-3.0b1 released ------

2004-11-18  Andras Varga

	* menuproc.tc: added exit confirmation question "Do you want to call
	finish() before exiting? Yes No Cancel"

2004-11-03  ------ omnetpp-3.0a9 released ------

2004-11-01  Andras Varga

	* main.tcl, modinsp2.tcl: created display string tag for icon size:
	"is=" (can be "vl", "l", "n", "s", "vs" for very large, large, normal,
	small, very small). Similarly, tag "is2=" sets size of auxiliary icon
	("i2=" tag). The underscore notation ("i=penguin_s") also still exists.

2004-10-27  Andras Varga

	* tkapp.cc: fix: readPerRunOptions() was not protected by try/catch

2004-10-25  Andras Varga

	* tkapp.cc, tkcmd.cc, etc: updated for info() and fullPath()
	signature changes (see include/ChangeLog)

2004-10-20  Andras Varga

	* main.tcl, modinsp2.tcl: preparations for new icons, categorized into
	several subdirs under bitmaps/. Current icons will be moved to
	into the bitmaps/old subdirectory.

	Tkenv now loads icons from subdirectories of dirs in OMNETPP_BITMAP-
	_PATH as well, and they can be referenced from display strings like
	"subdir/icon", "subdir/subsubdir/icon" , etc. If an icon "icon" in
	a display string is not found, it is tried as "old/icon" as well.

2004-10-18  Andras Varga

	* usability improvement: allowed user interactions during message
	animation (speed can be changed, STOP button can be clicked, inspector
	can be closed, etc). In Tcl-speak: changed "update idletasks" to
	"update" within animation code (graphmodwin_do_animate, etc).

	* tkinsp2.tcl: animation changed to use [clock clicks]-based timing

2004-10-15  Andras Varga

	* modinsp2.tcl, tkcmd.cc: fixed display strings: didn't handle "," and
	"=" in args to "t=" properly

	* tkapp.cc: improved "Fast Run until next local event" function: now
	it always animates events occurring in the local module

2004-10-15  Andras Varga

	* window.tcl: fix: "View file" option didn't like some file names

2004-10-10  Andras Varga

	* inspector.cc, tkutil.cc/h: fix: label always displayed "0 objects"
	above inspector listboxes; refactoring

2004-10-10  Andras Varga

	* main.tcl: changed default "Run until" run mode to Express (was Normal)

2004-10-04  ------ omnetpp-3.0a8 released ------

2004-09-27  Andras Varga

        * inspector.cc: display class name too on "inspect" buttons
        (e.g. "encapsulated message" button in cMessage inspector)

2004-09-26  Andras Varga

        * modinsp2.tcl: graphical module windows: adjust window size to fit
        size of graphics

2004-09-24  ------ omnetpp-3.0a7 released ------

2004-09-08  Andras Varga

        * widgets.tcl: updated Tcl/Tk version check

2004-08-16  Andras Varga

        * tkutil.cc: worked around compilation error in WinSCard.h when
        compiling with MSVC .NET

2004-08-14  Andras Varga

        * tkapp.cc: new omnetpp.ini entry: [Tkenv]/bitmap-path=. Value should
        be quoted; directories should be separated by ";". The contents of the
        OMNETPP_BITMAP_PATH environment var (or if that's not set, the
        compilation-time bitmap path) gets concatenated to this one.
        Beware: if you don't quote the value, only the first dir will be
        used and the rest ignored, because ";" denotes comments omnetpp.ini!

2004-08-12  Andras Varga

        * modinsp2.tcl: "t=" tag: center text by default

2004-07-22  ------ omnetpp-3.0a6 released ------

2004-07-17  Andras Varga

        * tkapp.cc: enable output (set disable_tracing=false) before calling
        finish()

2004-06-07  ------ omnetpp-3.0a5 released ------

2004-05-15  ------ omnetpp-3.0a4 released ------

2004-03-22  ------ omnetpp-3.0a3 released ------

2004-04-20  Andras Varga

        * added "Control Info" page into cMessage inspector.

2004-03-18  Andras Varga

        * structinsp.cc: display getFieldsAsString() also for structs (that is,
        its operator<< is used to display a one-line brief of the struct)

2004-03-03  ------ omnetpp-3.0a2 released ------

2004-03-03  Andras Varga

        * modinsp2.tcl, etc: implemented option to display className() of
        animated messages. New omnetpp.ini option:
          [Tkenv]/animation-msgclassnames=true/false (default is true)

2004-03-01  Andras Varga

        * inspector.tcl/cc, etc: all inspector windows got an "Inspect owner"
        toolbar button; on module inspectors this works as "Inspect parent
        module".

        * fix: Filtered Object List dialog ignored scheduled events list

        * fix: cPacket inspector "Fields" page was always empty

2004-02-23  Andras Varga

        * tkapp.cc/h: added moduleReparented() cEnvir method

2004-02-18  Andras Varga

        * tkapp.cc/h, menuproc.tcl: on-the-fly switching from one runmode to
        another (run,normal,express)

        * menuproc.tcl,dialogs.tcl: added [x] Confirm exit checkbox to
        Simulation options dialog

        * dialogs.tcl: express mode "STOP" dialog refined

        * dialogs.tcl: Find dialog improved

2004-02-11  Andras Varga

        * tkapp.cc: propagated semantic change in getNextEvent()'s and
        selectNextModule()'s return value (see include/ChangeLog)

2004-02-07  Andras Varga

        * cstructinsp.cc: fix: prepare for missing descriptor object
        [bug reported by Kurtis Kredo]

2004-02-04  ------ omnetpp-3.0pre1 released ------

2004-01-20  Andras Varga

        * added Edit|Copy to menu

2004-01-17  Andras Varga

        * modinsp2.tcl: added two experimental submodule display string tags:
        - "i2=" tag (with similar syntax to "i=") displays a small "modifier"
        icon on top of the original one. Suggested icons are x_check, x_down,
        x_up, x_exclamation, x_question, etc.
        - "t=" tag displays a status string. t=<text>,<pos>,<color>.
        <pos> is "l", "r" or "t" for left, right and top.

2004-01-09  Andras Varga

        * modinsp.cc/h/tcl,tkapp.cc/h: implemented bubble() -- submodules
        can display a bubble with a short message like "Queue full!".
        Added [Tkenv]/show-bubbles=true/false omnetpp.ini entry.
        TBD bubble() drawing could be a bit faster (too much Tcl code)

        * added anim speed slider in main dialog and graphical module inspector

2004-01-06  Andras Varga

        * tkapp.h: added isGUI() (returns true)

2004-01-01  Andras Varga
        * tkapp.cc/h: handle new cEnvir notifications: moduleCreated(),
        moduleDeleted(), connectionCreated(), connectionRemoved(),
        displayStringChanged(cGate*), displayStringChanged(cModule*),
        displayStringAsParentChanged()

2003-12-30  Andras Varga

        * new omnetpp.ini entries:
        [Tkenv]/methodcalls-delay: sets delay after method call animation
        [Tkenv]/show-layouting: show layouting process of network graphics

2003-12-21  Andras Varga

        * graphlayout.cc/h, modinsp.cc: implemented automatic layouting, using
        the SpringEmbedder algorithm. Modules which have no explicit positions
        assigned (first two args of the "p=" tag are missing) will be
        autolayouted. Predefined row, matrix, ring, etc arrangements (defined
        via 3rd and further args of the "p=" tag) will be moved as one unit
        (the full row/matrix/ring will be moved to an optimal place.)
        - One tricky thing: if the full graph is too big after layouting,
        it is scaled back so that it fits on the screen, UNLESS IT CONTAINS
        ANY FIXED-POSITION MODULE. (For obvious reasons: if there's a module
        with manually specified position, we don't want to move that one).
        - Size is ignored by the present layouter, so longish modules (such as
        an Ethernet segment) may produce funny results.
        - Parameters to the layouter algoritm (repulsive/attractive forces,
        number of iterations,random number seed) can be specified in the "l="
        tag to the parent module, but this is experimental and may change.
        Currently parameters (with their default values):
        "l=<repulsion=10>,<attraction=0.3>,<edgelen=40>,<maxiter=200>,<seed>"
        - Tip: to present rescaling, specify a bounding box for the parent
        module module that is large enough, e.g. "b=2000,3000"

2003-12-18  Andras Varga

        * modinsp2.tcl: enhanced "i=" (icon) display string tag -- icon can
        be colorized now. Syntax: i=<icon>,<target-color>,<percentage>.
        Target-color can be any accepted color specification: English name
        (blue,lightgray,wheat), RGB (#ff0000) or HSB (@40ff80; hue-saturation-
        brightness), and percentage is the degree of colorization, 20% being
        the default. Percentage has no effect if the target color is missing.
        Brightness of icon is also affected -- to keep original brightness,
        specify a color with about 50% brightness (e.g. #808080 mid-grey,
        #008000 mid-green). Examples: "i=server1,gold" creates
        a gold server icon; "i=earth2,#808080,100" makes icon grayscale;
        "i=queue,white,100" gives "over-exposed" b&w icon. Colorization
        works with both submodule and message icons.

        * tkcmd.cc: added opp_colorizeimage command

2003-12-11  Andras Varga

        * all files: follow changes in sim/; C-style casts replaced with
        static_cast<>

2003-12-06  Andras Varga

        * inspectors are no longer cObjects

        * "putaside queue" tab removed from simple module inspector (putaside-
        queue is being removed, see doc/API-changes.txt)

        * filtered object dialog enhanced (categories, etc)

2003-11-29  Andras Varga

        * insplist.tcl: added <pluginname>:inspectorUpdate Tkenv plugin
        callback

        * widgets.tcl: added BLT support

        * inspector listboxes changed to multicolumn listboxes from BLT

        * .cc/.h files: some refactoring and cleanup; lots of obsolete code
        removed

2003-11-13  Andras Varga

        * statinsp.cc: added typecast for MSVC 7.0 compiler [reported by Bob
        Scheffler]

2003-11-13  Andras Varga

        * Checked in parallel simulation code that was developed March-May 2003,
        during my stay at Monash University. Changes:

        2003-04-09  Andras Varga
        * tkapp.cc: use new cSimulation method guessNextEvent() for updating
        "Next module" display.

2003-11-09  Andras Varga

        * added toolbar icon and menu item for dynamically loading NED files.
        (Only works if sim.kernel was compiled with the feature enabled,
        see sim/ChangeLog entry from the same date.)

2003-11-07  Andras Varga

        * started working on a Tkenv plugin API. It's still in embryonal state.
        Plugins are any .tcl file found in directories of the plugin path
        (OMNETPP_PLUGIN_PATH env.var, "./plugins" be default), and they are
        loaded automatically when Tkenv starts. They may define Tcl procs,
        create windows, widgets, meu items, etc.
           The plugin may invoke the registerPlugin <pluginname> Tcl function,
        which arranges certain plugin functions to be called on different
        Tkenv events. As of now, the only such function is
        <pluginname>:newNetwork, called after a network got set up.
           As of now, plugins authors need to look at the Tkenv code to see
        what they can do and how they can do it from within a plugin. This is
        not very good since it makes plugins dependent on Tkenv internals.
        Some time in the future a well-defined Tkenv API will have to be
        created. Also, the plugin mechanism will probably be changed to
        make use of the namespace and package mechanisms of Tcl.
           An example plugin can be found in test/tkenv/plugin.

        * tkcmd.cc: implemented opp_modulebypath, opp_getmodulepar,
        opp_setmodulepar commands (needed by Tkenv plugins)

2003-10-19  Andras Varga

        * slight change in submodule display strings: if both "b=" (box) and
        "i=" (icon) occurs in the display string, *both* are displayed
        (the icon on top of the box; prevoiusly, the icon took precedence).
        This facilitates visualizing the state of a module: state can be coded
        in the color (or size) of the underlying box or oval (or frame/circle,
        because transparency is also supported, see below)

        * enhancement in display strings: special color "-" means transparent;
        @hhssbb (with h,s,b as hex digits) stands for a color given with
        (hue,saturation,brightness) values -- this makes it easier to scale
        colors e.g. from white to bright red

        * tkcmd.cc: added opp_hsb_to_rgb command

2003-10-18  Andras Varga

        * tkcmd.cc: added Tcl commands for working with the nedxml library

2003-10-06  Andras Varga

        * modinsp2.tcl, modinsp.h/cc: new feature: queue size can be displayed
        next to submodule icon. Add "q=<queue-name>" to the display string,
        where queue-name is the name of the cQueue object, e.g. "q=sendQueue".

        * tkenvrc now saves all options. Entries in the [Tkenv] section of
        omnetpp.ini will be obsoleted -- anyway they only take effect if
        there's no .tkenvrc!

2003-10-02  Andras Varga

        * tkapp.cc/h, modinsp.cc/h, modinsp2.tcl: new features:
        (1) animation of method calls across modules (for that to work,
            module methods need the Enter_Method() macro to be added manually),
            and
        (2) displaying the location of the next event by putting a red frame
            around the module icon.
        Both features can be disabled from the Simulation Options dialog,
        see checkboxes "Show next event markers" and "Animate method calls".
        New ini file options in the [Tkenv] section:
          next-event-markers = true/false, default is true
          anim-methodcalls = true/false, default is true

2003-09-25  Andras Varga

        * modinsp2.tcl: added support for "r" submodule display string tag.
        It draws a circle (or a disc) around the submodule with the given
        radius, and it can be used to visualize transmission range of
        wireless nodes. Syntax: "r=<radius>,<fillcolor>,<color>,<width>",
        the default is unfilled black circle with radius=100.

        * modinsp2.tcl: implemented message display strings. You can redefine
        the displayString() method of cMessage, and make it return a display
        string. Supported tags are: "b","i" and "o" tags which work just as
        with submodules, with two exceptions:
        - if color name is "kind", a message kind dependent colors is used
          (like default behaviour)
        - defaults are different: small red ball with size of 10 points
        Try "i=penguin" or "b=15,15,rect;o=white,kind,5"

2003-09-22  Andras Varga

        * tkapp.cc, modinsp.cc, modinsp2.tcl: implemented animation of
        sendDirect().

2003-09-01  Andras Varga

        * tkapp.cc: default values for update-freq-fast and update-freq-express
        changed to 50 and 10000

2003-07-24  Andras Varga

        * implemented Inspect|Find/Inspect objects dialog, a filtered-ordered
        dialog of all objects.

2003-07-22  Andras Varga

        * structinsp.cc/h: "Fields" tab in message inspector now recursively
        displays embedded structs (so far it only displayed "{...}")

2003-06-16  ------ omnetpp-2.3 released ------

2003-05-26  Andras Varga

        * cOutVector inspector: added "autoscale" checkbox to Options dialog

2003-04-17  Andras Varga

        * objinsp.tcl: fixed bug which prevented cPackets (or objects
        subclassed from it) from being inspected (Tcl error)

2003-03-15  ------ omnetpp-2.3b2 released ------

2003-03-13  Andras Varga

        * modinsp2.tcl: fixed occasional "conn_id: no such variable" error

2003-02-15  ------ omnetpp-2.3b1 released ------

2003-02-05  Andras Varga

        * modinsp2.tcl: bugfix

2003-01-29  Andras Varga

        * added "Finish" to main toolbar

        * known bug: if one sets up the Token Ring sample with 120 nodes
        (other numbers work as well), displayed ring will be broken at places.

2003-01-23  Andras Varga

        * "Step" button in module inspectors replaced with 3 buttons ("Run
        until next local event", "Fast run until next local event", "Stop")

        * Graphical module inspector: if there're too many submodules, drawing
        may take very long, so the user is prompted if he/she really wants
        see the graphics. Limit is currently 1000 submodules.
        The object tree view is also usable until ~1000 objects displayed in
        the tree.

        * Note: ad-hoc load tests: with Dyna, a 8000-client network could be set
        up and run (~12500 modules, including ServerProcs) on Win2K, 256M RAM.
        A modified version of Fifo2 (n independent Fifo networks, each with
        3 modules using handleMessage()) could be set up with n=33300, that is,
        ~100,000 modules. Process size was 280M, so it couldn't be run (too
        less physical RAM). Both auto-inspectors (.tkenvrc) and displaying the
        object tree view were very slow over a few thousand modules.

2003-01-19  Andras Varga

        * Cygwin fixes; put checkTckTkVersion and setupTkOptions (was generic_-
        bindings) into widgets.tcl

2003-01-16  Andras Varga

        * enhancement: inspectors: made buttons that open inspectors for other
        objects (e.g. encapsulated message in message inspector) look like
        other inspector fields (i.e. label+button).

2003-01-14  Andras Varga

        * enhancement: graphical module inspector: don't bug the user with
        error dialogs if icon for a module is not found; just only display
        the 'unknown' icon.

2003-01-12  Andras Varga

        * enhancement: usability fixes on the inspector type selection dialog

2003-01-11  Andras Varga

        * enhancement: main.tcl: appearance of menus on Unix made more
        contemporary (via option add's)

2003-01-10  Andras Varga

        * enhancement: implemented object tree view on left of main Tkenv
        window

2003-01-06  Andras Varga

        * misc enhancements: display string added to module inspectors
        (editable); inspector toolbar improved; rest of Tcl_SetResult() fixed;
        submodule drawing (interpretation of display strings) made entirely
        consistent with GNED; subtle bug fixed which sometimes caused display
        string updates not take effect.

        * layout handling rules slightly changed: "p=x,y" now ALWAYS means
        "p=x,y,exact", even if the submodule is part of a vector for which
        a "row" or "ring" autolayout is chosen automatically. (Before, "p=x,y"
        meant "p=x,y,row" or "p=x,y,ring" if the submod was in a vector,
        and this caused counterintuitive displacements because a (dx,dy) shift
        coming from the layout was superponed onto the position (x,y)).
        POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY.

2003-01-05  Andras Varga

        * enhancements: New Run and New Network icons added to toolbar, etc.

2002-12-21  Andras Varga

        * all inspector windows: added a "name bar" which displays object
        type, fullpath, with modules the module id, and the object pointer;
        also added color coding so that different inspectors of the same object
        are easier to match visually.

        * File|Create snapshot now offers to open the snapshot file in a viewer
        window.

        * added tooltips to graphical inspectors. I.e. if you position the
        mouse over a module icon, its name, type and id will appear in a
        tooltip.

        * added 'Simulation options' toolbar button; removed Tcl console from
        Options menu; other small UI changes

2002-12-07  Andras Varga

        * File|New network and File|New run dialogs now correctly offer choices
        of all available networks and all available run numbers

        * tkcmd.cc and other files: most direct assignments to interp->result
        changed to Tcl_SetResult(); the ones left are tagged with FIXME comments

2002-12-06  Andras Varga

        * main.tcl: added tooltips for gauges on toolbar

2002-11-24 Andras Varga

        * modinsp.tcl: with "ring" layout, changed order of modules
        from clockwise to the more natural counter-clockwise

        * bugfix: cHead could not be inspected

2002-11-12 Andras Varga

        * ported to Tk8.4 (several 'char *' to 'const char *' changes)

        * renamed several internal methods in tklib.cc for clarity

2002-11-03  Andras Varga

        * tkapp.cc: clear main window when simulation is restarted

2002-10-27  Andras Varga

        * inspect.cc, tkapp.cc,..: inspectorfactory registration moved here
        from sim/

        * reorganized source files (split large .cc and .h files)

        * reorganized the way inspectors are found and created

2002-10-26  Andras Varga

        * outvector inspectors: added basic labeling to axes

        * implemented that inspector windows are restored if you restart
        the simulation, and even if you quit/restart Tkenv. List of open
        inspectors is saved in ./tkenvrc which is automatically loaded
        on startup and written on exit.

        In .tkenvrc, inspectors are identified by object name (obj->fullPath())
        and class name (obj->className()), so make sure to use locally unique
        names for variables you want to inspect.

        Inspector windows usually cannot be opened immediately when .tkenvrc
        is loaded (the corresponding objects don't exist yet), so Tkenv keeps
        a "pending inspectors list" for the inspectors to be opened.
        At each display update, Tkenv tries to find the corresponding objects
        in the network and open inspectors for them. Be aware that this
        object search is relatively expensive operation, so Tkenv performance
        may degrade if there are too many pending inspectors. If the network
        you're running under Tkenv changes often, it's a good idea to
        delete .tkenvrc manually sometimes to clean it from garbage (i.e. from
        obsolete entries).

2002-10-04  Andras Varga

        * error handling changed from simulation.ok() to exceptions.

2002-07-03  Andras Varga

        * modinsp2.tcl (graphmodwin_animate): set upper limit to animation
        steps (100) so that animation of a message sending finishes in
        tolerable time period even on very long connections.

2002-05-27  Ulrich Kaage  <kaage@int.uni-karlsruhe.de>

        * main.tcl (create_omnetpp_window): increased event number status
        bar field width by 3 digits - it was limited in size to 1.000.000
        events.

2002-05-04  ------ omnetpp-2.2 released ------

2002-03-14  Ulrich Kaage  <kaage@int.uni-karlsruhe.de>

        * tkapp.h: define TKENV_EXTRASTACK dependent on the system
        architecture. Currently SUNSPARC is known to need more stack space
        with TCL/TK 8.3

2002-03-08  Ulrich Kaage <kaage@int.uni-karlsruhe.de>

        * structinsp.cc (flush_if_needed): Compile Fix for gcc versions
        2.95.3 (complaints) and 3.0.x (errors): declare buf and s as non
        const function call arguments.

2002-03-08  Andras Varga

        * structinsp.cc (update()): keep buffer size low by periodically
        flushing it to the text widget

2002-03-05  Andras Varga

        * modinsp.cc, modinsp2.tcl: Bugfix: each display string change had
        the unwanted side effect of rearranging randomly placed submodules.
        Basic idea of fix: start Tcl's RNG from the same seed value
        at each redraw, thus we get identical results; seed is stored per
        (and in the) inspector object. 'Rearrange' button changes the seed to
        get a different arrangement.

2002-03-03  Andras Varga

        * tkapp.cc, tkapp.h, tkcmd.cc: adopted to changes in the sim kernel.
        (See include/ChangeLog)

        * windows.tcl: cosmetics on file viewer dialog.

        * main.tcl, menuproc.tcl: refinements on implementation of the
        View|Output vector file, Output scalar file, Snapshot file menu items.

2002-02-29  Andras Varga

        * dialogs.tcl: implemented backwards search/replace

2002-02-24  Andras Varga

        * tkapp.cc: improvement on breakpoint handling.

2002-02-06  Ulrich Kaage  <kaage@int.uni-karlsruhe.de>

        * objinsp.cc (update): fill in class info field with message's
        classname

        * objinsp.tcl (create_messageinspector): add class info

        * structinsp.cc (update): display value and name of enums

2002-01-23  Ulrich Kaage  <kaage@int.uni-karlsruhe.de>

        * objinsp.tcl (create_structpanel): Added vertical scrollbars for
        those who use a lot of message fields.

        * structinsp.cc (update): 4k as buf[] size is not enough
        especially for large messages containing arrays. I have set it to
        5M !!

2001-11-25  Andras Varga

        * implemented "message subclassing": message inspectors have now a
        Fields page which displays fields exposed through the cStructDescriptor
        interface. (If there's no cStructDescriptor for the object, the Fields
        tab is missing.)

        * the default object inspector has been improved; it also displays a
        Fields page if there's a cStructDescriptor for the object.

        * TODO: Fields page will have to be refined (now it's a simple
        multi-line text widget).

        * widget.tcl: label texts created with label-sunkenlabel are now
        justfied left

2001-09-14  Andras Varga

        * updated to cModule's new display string methods

2001-09-11  Andras Varga

        * improved plugin handling: reads plugins from OMNETPP_PLUGIN_PATH
        which can be a list of directories (not just a single directory name).
        OMNETPP_PLUGIN_PATH is currently set to ./plugins (hardcoded).
        DLL file names that are looked for now correctly depend on the
        platform (*.dll on windows, .so* on *nix).

2001-09-01 Andras Varga

        * CONST_CAST() replaced by const_cast<>()

2001-07-23  Ulrich Kaage  <kaage@int.uni-karlsruhe.de>

        * tkcmd.cc (simulationOk_cmd): use macro CONST_CAST (defined at top of
        file) to avoid compilation errors with gcc-2.95.3
        (isRunning_cmd): CONST_CAST like above

2001-07-11 Andras Varga

        * tkapp.cc: Eric Wu's Tru64/MPI port. Added a few const_cast<>s because
        broken Tru64 compiler gave const errors with tcl.h.

2001-03-27  Andras Varga

        * ------ omnetpp-2.1 released ------

        * Makefile.vc change: replaced $(TKENV_EMBED_SUFFIX) with $(TKENV_EMBED_TCL).

2001-03-10  Andras Varga

        * bugfix: setDisplayString() crashed Tkenv after the network
        graphics window was closed [reported by Stefan Geisler]

        * Borland C++ support removed: I deleted the project files
        (*.ide). I added equivalent Makefile.bc files (generated from the
        BC IDE), but they are completely unsupported at the moment. If
        there's interest, it's possible that later I'll add makefiles for
        the free command-line bc5.5 compiler.

2001-02-06  Andras Varga

        * ------ omnetpp-2.0p1 released ------

        * ------ omnetpp-2.0 released ------

        * make clean didn't delete tclcode.cc

2001-01-21  Andras Varga

        * "find" and "find next" functionality improved and now it works
        for all module output windows. Hotkeys: Ctrl-F Find, F3 or Ctrl-N
        Find next.

        * added hotkeys for step, run, etc commands: F4 Step, F5 Run, F6
        Fast Run, F7 Express Run, F8 Stop, Ctrl-F4 Step within module

2001-01-16  Andras Varga

        * fix: added Tcl_FindExecutable(argv[0]) to Tcl initialization
        code (needed by Cygwin 1.1)

2001-01-15  Andras Varga

        * new feature: debug output window (for ev<< messages) can now be
        opened for compound modules too: it accumulates messages from all
        submodules.
        [suggested by Ulrich Kaage]

        * single-stepping within a module is now possible for compound
        modules too

        * revised single-stepping within a module: now execution stops
        both *before* and *after* events in that module, and events in
        that module are done with "normal execution" (animation, etc),
        while intervening events are done with "fast execution" (rare
        inspector updates, animation disabled)

2001-01-13  Andras Varga

        * added performance status bar (simsec/sec, events/sec, events/simsec gauges)

2001-01-03  Andras Varga

        * added 2nd status bar (containing: number of messages in the FES,
        total number of messages created, number of currently existing
        message objects)

2000-09-29  Andras Varga

        * fixed a bug which caused Tkenv NOT to report an error when the
        'p' display string tag's 3rd arg (layout) was invalid

        * the 'p' display string tag's 3rd arg (layout) can now be
        abbreviated: r=row, c=col=column, m=matrix, i=ri=ring

        * added new layout to 'p' tag: exact (abbreviation: e or x); this
        lets one position modules in a module vector one by one

        * submodule display strings may use the parent module's parameters
        too

2000-08-07  Andras Varga

        * makefile changes for RPM support

2000-07-26  Andras Varga

        * fixed a bug which caused Tcl error when using ev<< or
        ev.printf() with a string than contained curly braces [reported by
        Nick van Foreest]

        * added Edit|Find... to main menu.

2000-07-17 Andras Varga

        * fixed bug in splitInspectorName()  [reported by Ulrich Kaage]

2000-06-02  Andras Varga

        * ------ omnetpp-2.0b5 released ------

        * minor fix in tkcmd.cc [reported by Richard Lyon]

2000-05-21  Andras Varga

        * ------ omnetpp-2.0b4 released ------

        * bugfix: 'Options|Load inspector list' now works again (you must
        re-generate your existing inspect.lst files)

2000-05-10  Andras Varga

        * [Tkenv]/extra-stack= option added, it specifies (in bytes) how
        much extra stack each activity() module needs when executing under
        Tkenv. This used to be hardcoded (16384), now users can fine-tune
        it. [suggested by Niko]

2000-05-07  Andras Varga

        * Makefile.vc improvements [from Balazs Kelemen]

        * tk_PatchLevel check corrected (complained about Tk 8.0.5)
        [reported by Ulrich Kaage]

2000-05-05  Andras Varga

        * implemented module parameter substitution in display strings
        (like "p=$x_pos,$y_pos"). Substitution still not supported in
        connection display strings.

        * setDisplayString() now takes effect during simulation
        execution. Tkenv also handles the new 'immediate' argument to
        setDisplayString().  Annoyance: setDisplayString() also does a
        'Rearrange randomly placed submodules'. This is not so trivial to
        change (module positions will need to be explicitly stored)...

2000-04-13  Andras Varga

        * code for Express Run (runSimulationNoTracing()) modified so that
        it prints module output (ev<<...) for the finish() functions
        [suggested by Niko]

2000-04-10  Andras Varga

        * TRUE/FALSE (defines) replaced by true/false (C++ keywords)

        * in printf() statements, all "%lf","%lg","%le" was replaced by
        "%f","%g","%e" (eliminated a lot of gcc -Wall warnings)

2000-04-10  Andras Varga (4-10)

        * dynamic registration of user interface (TOmnetApp) classes
        introduced: Register_OmnetApp() macro added to tkapp.cc

        * changes to enable linking a Windows DLL from the library

        * adjustments because of TOmnetApp constructor changes

        * added tkenvDummy()/envirDummy(): functions which can/should be
        called from Envir in order to force the linker to include the
        Tkenv library into the executable. (These functions do absolutely
        nothing.)

2000-03-26  Andras Varga

        * 'char *' pointers made const-correct (lots of 'char *' -->
        'const char *' replacements throughout the code)

2000-01-17  Andras Varga (17-18)

        * ------ omnetpp-2.0b3 released ------

        * bugfix in OmnetTkApp::objectDeleted() (tkapp.cc)

        * edited error msgs in tkapp.cc

        * font settins updated for Tk8.2/Win in main.tcl

        * in dialogs.tcl, added back the grab for the STOP dialog of
        Express Run mode. (Those lines got commented out long ago for some
        reason...) Under win32, the app menu is still accessible despite
        the grab (Tk bug?).

2000-01-15  Andras Varga

        * OmnetTkApp::setup() reorganized

2000-01-09  Andras Varga

        * small modification to TOmnetTkApp's constructor

1999-12-05  Andras Varga

        * Makefile.vc added

        * prints a banner line into main window before calling finish() on
        modules TBD: should print it into per-module windows too

1999-12-04  Andras Varga

        * compiled with MSVC. Minor changes: changed int to bool in some
        places.  tkenv.dsp added. NOTE: one has to rename all .cc files to
        .cpp for compiling (ren *.cc *.cpp)!

1999-10-12  Andras Varga

        * bugfix in balloon.tcl

1999-09-05  Andras Varga

        * ------ omnetpp-2.0b2 released ------

        * main window renamed from ".omnetpp" to "."; now modal dialogs
        cannot go behind the main window (including the big red "STOP!"
        dialog).

1999-08-30  Andras Varga

        * bugfix on the toolbar of graphical gate inspector

1999-08-13  Andras Varga

        * default width of connection arrows changed from 2 to 1 pixels to
        be consistent with GNED

1999-08-07 Andras Varga

        * "inspect network", "inspect FES" buttons added to main toolbar

1999-08-02  Andras Varga

        * OMNETPP_BITMAP_PATH turned into real path (a list of
        directories). The separator char is ";" on Windows, and ":" or ";"
        on Unix.

1999-07-17  Andras Varga

        * modinsp2.tcl: fixed bug in animdelay calibration

        * fixed a bug with inspector type selection in Inspect|By pattern
        matching..

1999-07-11  Andras Varga

        * icons.tcl added; textual toolbar icons replaced with graphics icons

        * note: because the name of each inspector window is unique, the
        help_tips() array grows monotonously as one opens new and new
        inspector windows. The array is NOT cleaned up after closing an
        insp.  window. In everyday use this small memory leak cannot be a
        problem.

        * TO DO: spaces to be added between icons

        * widgets.tcl edited --> copy it to other subdirs
1999-07-10  Andras Varga

        * arrow.cc updated from GNED (enhancement: default value of
        anchors are now 50%)

        * widgets.tcl updated from GNED

        * modinsp2.tcl: removed potential sources of division by zero

        * fixed a problem in printptr() [tklib.cc] which caused a crash on
        Sun

        * now demands at least Tcl/Tk 8.0 patchlevel 1

1999-06-21  Andras Varga

        * support for compiled-in TCL code added.  See the makefile for
        more info and to turn it on/off.  Here's how it works: tcl2c.c
        generates tclcode.cc from the .tcl files.  tclcode.cc is in turn
        included into tkapp.cc. tkapp.cc includes tclcode.cc and uses
        compiled-in TCL code if OMNETPP_TKENV_DIR is undefined at
        compile-time.

1998-04-24  Andras Varga

        NEW FEATURE: graphical module inspectors and animation
          Modules are now displayed graphically. Submodules can be drawn as
          color rectangles, ovals or icons. (Icons are stored in the new bitmaps/
          directory.)
          Placement, arrangement and appearance of submodules is controlled by
          the modules' display strings, associated with the setDisplayString(),
          displayString() members of cModule and cGate. If you use the new
          'display:' phrases of the NED language, the corresponding
          setDisplayString() calls will be automatically placed into the
          nedc-compiled code. Read doc/dispstr.txt on how to write display strings.
          Modules that don't have display strings are placed automatically.
          Animation of message flow has also been added.
        New ini file options:
          [Tkenv]/animation-enabled= 0/1
        Some of the Tcl code cleaned up.
        Changes:

          * TKENV_LIBPATH environment variable renamed to OMNETPP_TKENV_DIR.

          * A new environment variable OMNETPP_BITMAP_DIR added.

        Requires sim156.
        TO DO:

          * implement reference to module parameters in display strings

          * graphical cGate inspector, showing whole path

          * graphical cQueue inspector

1998-04-15  Andras Varga (15-24)

        * work versions, not released

1998-03-26  Andras Varga

        * "Inspect As" button only offers really existing inspector types as choice

        * container inspectors redesigned to make it more intuitive to use

1998-03-19  Andras Varga

        * user interface beautifying, updating for Tk8.0

1998-02-15  Andras Varga

        * makefile changed; tkenv.a-->libtkenv.a

1997-12-13  Andras Varga

        * upgraded to sim151

        * use file dialogs of Tk4.2 - requires Tcl7.6/Tk4.2 from now on

        * some Tk beautifying (correct wrong packing parameters etc)

1997-10-06  Andras Varga

        * further renaming; compatible with sim148

1997-10-02  Andras Varga

        * cleaned up & renamed several member functions; compatible with sim147

1997-08-17  Andras Varga

        * updated for sim146a
               cMsgHeap inspector added
               extrastack() stuff added

        Still To Do:

           - "step over initialization messages"

           - cGate graphical inspector: should show the route

           - filtered message window

           - restart must be done decently: destroy+rebuild

           - implement breakpoints

           - cCompoundMod graphical inspector

           - outvector graphical inspector: add possibility to set base time

           - implement "run until event #243"

           - objects should know what inspector types can be created for
           them.  This can be done in the inspector(int type, void *data)
           function: if type==QUERY_TYPES then it should put list of
           possible types to memory pointed to by `data' ptr.

1997-08-07  Andras Varga
