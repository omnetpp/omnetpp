2024-09-27  Attila Torok

	* Fix: Make the MPI implementation of parsim actually get built in
	when available and requested, by adding missing inclusions of
	platdep/config.h before any WITH_MPI (or WITH_PARSIM) macro usages.

2022-05-16  Attila Torok

	* Use C++ headers instead of C ones, e.g. <cstdlib> instead of <stdlib.h>

2022-04-11  ------ omnetpp-6.0 released ------

2022-04-05  Andras Varga

	* Replace memcpy() with std::copy_n(), to avoid calling memcpy() with
	nullptr as 2nd arg, even with size=0. memcpy() declares that its src
	argument cannot be nullptr, and clang sanitizers warn if it's called
	with src=nullptr, even if size=0.

2020-11-13  Attila Torok

	* Modernizing: Use in-class member initializers wherever possible;
	use "=default" syntax for copy constructors where appropriate.
	Tool: clang-tidy plus manual editing where needed.

2020-08-07  Attila Torok

	* cNamedPipeCommunications: Reduce blocking timeout from 1s to 0.1s,
	to make the GUI a bit more responsive when parsim is in use.

2020-07-27  Andras Varga

	* Parsim support code adapted to the new transmission updates API.
	Most changes come from the need to follow the signature change of
	cGate::deliver(), especially the addition of SendOptions as parameter.
	Due to that, whenever a cMessage is sent from one partition to another,
	it needs to be accompanied by the SendOptions. Thus, SendOptions needs to
	be packed/unpacked, etc.

2020-06-08  Andras Varga

	* Parsim code to take the number of partitions explicitly from the new
	"parsim-num-partitions" config option, instead of "-p" command-line
	option (named pipes) or from MPI.

2020-06-09  Andras Varga

	* cNamedPipeCommunications: implemented tag filtering

	* Modernizing: use C++11's range-based for loops where applicable, using
	clang-tidy's modernize-loop-convert.

	* Modernizing: replace INT64_PRINTF_FORMAT and LL with C++11's PRId64.
	Note: PRId64 includes the "d" that was not part of INT64_PRINTF_FORMAT
	alias LL.

	- removed related macros: NAMESPACE_BEGIN, NAMESPACE_END,
	  USING_NAMESPACE, OPP, OPP_STR, OPP_PREFIX etc.

2015-07-20  ------ omnetpp-5.0b2 released ------

2015-06-16  Andras Varga

	* Cleanup: prefer ++it to it++ (less copying)

2015-06-12  Andras Varga

	* Adapted to simkernel iterator API changes (added operator* and
	operator->, deprecated operator())

2015-06-16  Andras Varga

	* Adapted to FES-related simkernel API changes

2015-06-08  Andras Varga

	* Cleanup: code formatting

2015-05-22  Andras Varga

	* Modernizing: added the 'override' keyword (C++11) to overridden methods;
	it becomes blank when using with an older compiler.

2015-05-21  Rudolf Hornig

	* Modernizing: replaced NULLs by 'nullptr' (C++11); it is defined as 0
	when using an older compiler.

2015-04-20  Andras Varga

	* Cleanup: use C++ names of C headers (e.g. <cstdio> instead of <stdio.h>)

2015-04-12  Andras Varga

	* Cleanup: copyright years updated

2015-04-08  Andras Varga

	* Modernizing:

	- Use a fixed include path (-Iinclude -Isrc) for all source folders
	  under src/, and qualify cross-folder #includes with the folder
	  name (e.g. change #include "stringutil.h" to #include "common/stringutil.h").
	  This increases readbility and reduces the chance of including a wrong
	  header.

	- In source files, sort #include statements by folder.

	* cmpicomm.cc: fix: use status.MPI_SOURCE in MPI_Recv() call after
	MPI_Probe()/MPI_Iprobe(), not MPI_ANY_SOURCE; more info at:
	http://www.mpi-forum.org/docs/mpi-11-html/node50.html [reported by
	Cyriel Minkenberg and Robert Birke]

2011-02-23  ------ omnetpp-4.2b1 released ------

	* cparsimpartition.cc: connectRemoteGates() failed for some
	cases of deep partitioning

	* clinkdelaylookahead: failed for some cases of deep partitioning

	* clinkdelaylookahead: we now use the lookahead from the whole path,
	not only from the link that connects to the placeholder module

	* cplaceholdermodule.cc/h: added an info() function that produces
	a string containing the "placeholder" text

2004-12-29  ------ omnetpp-3.0 released ------

2004-12-13   Andras Varga

	* several values made configurable; all entries below are in the
	[General] section:

	parsim-debug = <true/false>
	   default: true
	parsim-mpicommunications-mpibuffer = <bytes>
	   default: 256K * (numPartitions-1) + 16K;
	   Size of MPI send buffer to allocate; see MPI_Buffer_attach()
	   MPI call. If the buffer is too small, a deadlock can occur.
	parsim-namedpipecommunications-prefix = <string>
	   Control the naming of named pipes.
	   Windows: default value is "omnetpp", which means that pipe names
	   will be of the form "\\.\pipe\omnetpp-xx-yy" (where xx and yy are
	   numbers).
	   Unix: default value is "comm/", which means that the named pipes
	   will be created with the name "comm/pipe-xx-yy". The "comm/"
	   subdirectory must already exist when the simulation is launched.
	parsim-filecommunications-prefix = <string>
	   default: "comm/"
	parsim-filecommunications-preserve-read = <true/false>
	   default: false
	parsim-filecommunications-read-prefix = <string>
	   default: "comm/read/"
	   The above 3 options control the cFileCommunicatinos class.
	   By default, it deletes files that were read. By enabling the
	   "preserve-read" setting, you can make it move read files to
	   another directory instead ("comm/read/" by default).
	   BEWARE: for mysterious reasons, it appears that there cannot be more
	   than about 19800 files in a directory. When that point is reached,
	   an exception is thrown somewhere inside the standard C library, which
	   materializes itself in OMNeT++ as an "Error: (null)" message...
	   Strangely, this can be reproduced in both Linux and Windows.
	parsim-nullmessageprotocol-lookahead-class = <class name string>
	   default: "cLinkDelayLookahead"
	   Selects the lookahead class for the Null Message Algorithm; the
	   class must be subclassed from cNMPLookahead.
	parsim-nullmessageprotocol-laziness = <0..1>
	   default: 0.5
	   Controls how often the Null Message Algorithm should send out null
	   messages; the value is understood in proportion to the lookahead,
	   e.g. 0.5 means every lookahead/2 simsec.
	parsim-idealsimulationprotocol-tablesize = <int>
	   default: 100,000
	   Size of chunks (in table entries) in which the external events
	   file (recorded by cISPEventLogger) should be loaded.
	   (one entry is 8 bytes, so 100,000 corresponds to ~800K allocated
	   memory)

2004-03-03  ------ omnetpp-3.0a2 released ------

2004-03-01  Andras Varga

	* classes cParsimCommunications, cCommBuffer, cParsimPartition,
	cNMPLookahead became subclassed from cPolymorphic so that they work
	with updated Register_Class()/createOne(). (cParsimSynchronization
	was already a cPolymorhpic, via the cScheduler base class.)

2004-02-12  Andras Varga

	* cproxygate.cc/.h: fix: local copy of messages sent out from the
	partition was not deleted

	* communications classes: provided default impl. for broadcast()
	in base class; broadcastException() to "eat" exceptions during
	broadcasting exception (not interested in stacked exceptions...)

2004-02-11  Andras Varga

	* receiveNonblocking() changed to return false if it was interrupted;
	now it's possible to stop (and resume) parallel simulation in Tkenv.

	* implemented message filtering by tag in the communications classes
	(cParsimCommunications subclasses) -- needed to handle race conditions
	in connectRemoteGates()

2004-02-04  ------ omnetpp-3.0pre1 released ------

2003-11-13  Andras Varga

	* checked in parallel simulation code that was developed March-May 2003,
	during my stay at Monash University.
