	* cNedDeclaration: cosmetics: Rename args, swap order of args, rename method
	(mergeProperties() -> updateProperties())

2022-04-11  ------ omnetpp-6.0 released ------

2021-11-04  Andras Varga

	* Mandate @mutable property for NED parameters that support being changed at
	runtime. To disable the check for models that don't have the necessary
	@mutable annotations added, add parameter-mutability-check=false to
	omnetpp.ini.

2021-07-10  Andras Varga

	* cNedNetworkBuilder: eliminate submodMap variable

2021-06-23  Andras Varga

	* cNedNetworkBuilder::doGate(): adjusted to recent cModule changes
	(use addGateVector() instead of addGate() for gate vector creation).

2021-06-16  Andras Varga

	* Report location for evaluation errors in parameter values set from NED files

2021-06-09  Andras Varga

	* NED: Allow the body of a parametric submodule to assign apparently nonexistent
	parameters.

	Example:

	        app: <default("FooApp")> like IApp {
	           parameters:
	               address = parent.address;
	               sleepTime = 1s;
	       }

	If FooApp has a sleepTime parameter but IApp does not, then running with
	the defaults is fine, but changing to another IApp type that does NOT
	have a sleepTime parameter will stop the simulation with an error.

	Solution: inside a parametric submodule type, we simply ignore parameter
	assignments that assign nonexistent parameters.

2021-06-09  Andras Varga

	* NED: fix parametric channel type with type given as default expression

	The expression text was mistakenly interpreted as parameter name.

	Example:
	   a.out++ --> <default(channelType+"")> like IFooChannel --> b.in++;

	It would give the following error:

	    Error: Unknown parameter '"bubu"+channelType+""'

2021-05-31  Andras Varga

	* NED: Implemented @omittedTypename property

	@omittedTypename allows one to specify a NED type to use when typename=""
	is specified for a parametric submodule or channel, or to remove (skip
	creating) that submodule, submodule vector element, or channel
	altogether.

	@omittedTypename can be specified on a module interface or channel
	interface, or on a submodule or connection. It should contain a single
	(optional) value. The value names the type to use. If it is absent, the
	submodule or channel will not be created. (The connection will be created
	without a channel object.)

2021-05-05  Andras Varga

	* Rudimentary support for the new "parent.something" syntax

2021-03-31  Andras Varga

	* More helpful error message for the "no gate left for '++' operator"
	NED error

2021-03-22  Andras Varga

	* cNedDeclaration: cosmetics

2020-11-13  Attila Torok

	* Modernizing: Use in-class member initializers wherever possible;
	use "=default" syntax for copy constructors where appropriate.
	Tool: clang-tidy plus manual editing where needed.

2019-11-19  Andras Varga

	* Support @class() property on NED parameters of type "object".
	Two variants: @class(classname) and @class(classname?); the difference
	is that parameters declared without question mark don't accept nullptr
	as value, while the ones with question mark do.

	The referenced class must be registered via Register_Class() or
	Register_Abstract_Class().

2019-10-24  Andras Varga

	* Added support for NED parameters of type "object".

2019-10-23  Andras Varga

	* Follow change: AstNode::getSourceLocation() return type changed from
	const char * to std::string.

2019-10-21  Andras Varga

	* cNedNetworkBuilder: When processing a parameter assignment in NED,
	call cParImpl::setBaseDirectory() with the location of NED file.
	This is needed for e.g. xmldoc() to be able to interpret the file name
	as relative to the directory the expression comes from.

2019-04-13  Andras Varga

	* cNedNetworkBuilder: improved error message: mention parameter name
	when an error occurs while setting up a parameter.

2019-03-11  Andras Varga

	* cNedNetworkBuilder: Ported NED to the new Expression class.

	The main change is the removal of duality in parsing/processing NED
	expressions. Expressions in NED files and INI files used to be parsed/built
	in totally different ways; now we use cDynamicExpression (which relies on
	the Expression class) for both. Consequences: cExpressionBuilder was
	eliminated; expression parsing turned OFF in NED parser (we don't use the
	AST built by it).

2020-01-06  ------ omnetpp-5.6 released ------

2019-10-22  Andras Varga

	* NED feature: allow reconnecting already connected gates by specifying
	the @reconnect property in the connection.

2019-05-15  ------ omnetpp-5.5 released ------

2018-06-25  ------ omnetpp-5.4.1 released ------

2018-06-11  ------ omnetpp-5.4 released ------

2018-05-23  Andras Varga

	* NED: Added "exists" operator. Syntax: exists(<submodulename>)

2018-05-18  Andras Varga

	* NED: implement "typename" in submodule "if" and other expressions

	Note: typename is not allowed in a submodule VECTOR's condition, because
	type is elementwise, and we want the condition to apply to the vector as
	a whole (we don't want to allow "holes" in the submodule vector)

2018-05-18  Andras Varga

	* cNedNetworkBuilder: fix: allow empty typename value to be used.
	Before, empty string meant "no value specified here", and search went on.

2018-05-17  Andras Varga

	* cNedNetworkBuilder: use cDynamicExpression not cParImpl for
	build-time expression evaluation.

2018-04-11  ------ omnetpp-5.3 released ------

2017-11-26  Andras Varga

	* Follow renames in the nedxml library: NEDElement -> ASTNode,
	NED->Ned in class/function names, etc.

2017-12-12  Andras Varga

	* Follow cPar longValue()->intValue() method rename.

2017-12-12  Andras Varga

	* Follow cPar change: cPar now uses intpar_t (alias of int64_t) to
	represent integers.

2017-12-08  ------ omnetpp-5.2.1 released ------

2017-09-18  ------ omnetpp-5.2 released ------

2017-04-06  Andras Varga

	* Modernizing: use C++11's range-based for loops where applicable, using
	clang-tidy's modernize-loop-convert.

	* Modernizing: replace INT64_PRINTF_FORMAT and LL with C++11's PRId64.
	Note: PRId64 includes the "d" that was not part of INT64_PRINTF_FORMAT
	alias LL.

2017-05-08  ------ omnetpp-5.1.1 released ------

2016-11-08  Andras Varga

	* Fixed NED_parampattern_5.test

2016-08-23  Andras Varga

	* Follow cComponentType change: added getNedSource() to subclasses

2016-08-23  Andras Varga

	* Follow changes: detailedInfo() removed, info() renamed to str()

2016-04-13  ------ omnetpp-5.0 released ------

2016-04-01  Andras Varga

	* Edited comments to improve the generated C++ documentation (doxygen)

2016-03-10  ------ omnetpp-5.0rc released ------

2015-12-07  ------ omnetpp-5.0b3 released ------

2015-10-16  Andras Varga

	* omnetpp namespace made permanent (cannot be turned off):
	- removed configure option and preprocessor symbol USE_NAMESPACE
	- removed related macros: NAMESPACE_BEGIN, NAMESPACE_END,
	  USING_NAMESPACE, OPP, OPP_STR, OPP_PREFIX etc.

2015-07-20  ------ omnetpp-5.0b2 released ------

2015-06-16  Andras Varga

	* Cleanup: prefer ++it to it++ (less copying)

2015-06-12  Andras Varga

	* Adapted to simkernel iterator API changes (added operator* and
	operator->, deprecated operator())

2015-06-08  Andras Varga

	* Cleanup: code formatting

2015-05-22  Andras Varga

	* Modernizing: added the 'override' keyword (C++11) to overridden methods;
	it becomes blank when using with an older compiler.

2015-05-21  Rudolf Hornig

	* Modernizing: replaced NULLs by 'nullptr' (C++11); it is defined as 0
	when using an older compiler.

2015-04-20  Andras Varga

	* Cleanup: use C++ names of C headers (e.g. <cstdio> instead of <stdio.h>)

2015-04-12  Andras Varga

	* Cleanup: copyright years updated

2015-04-08  Andras Varga

	* Modernizing:

	- Use a fixed include path (-Iinclude -Isrc) for all source folders
	  under src/, and qualify cross-folder #includes with the folder
	  name (e.g. change #include "stringutil.h" to #include "common/stringutil.h").
	  This increases readbility and reduces the chance of including a wrong
	  header.

	- In source files, sort #include statements by folder.

2014-06-30  ------ omnetpp-4.5 released ------

2014-02-03  Andras Varga

	* Follow the removal of cCompoundModule from the simulation library.
	From now on, compound modules are instantiated with cModule.

2014-02-13  ------ omnetpp-4.4.1 released ------

2011-04-20  Andras Varga

	* "type-name" per-object config option has been renamed to "typename",
	for consistency with NED. (It is now an exception to the rule that
	all per-object options have a hyphen in their names.)

2011-04-19  Andras Varga

	* implemented "typename" patterns, a way of assigning type to
	parametric submodule types without using parameters. The syntax
	is like deep parameter assignments, where the last component of
	the pattern is ".typename". Rules are the same as with deep param
	assignments: the innermost matching pattern with a non-default
	value will be effective; and default value can be overridden,
	i.e. the outermost pattern with a default(...) value will be the
	actual default (that becomes effective when the inifile does not
	specify a value via **.type-name). "typename" is not accepted in the
	body of the parametric submodule itself, because the value expression
	would have to be evaluated in the context of a submodule that
	does not exist yet.

	Example:
	  network Net {
	      parameters:
	          server.tcp.typename = "TCP_NSC";
	          host*.tcp.typename = default("TCP_lwIP");
	      submodule:
	          server: StandardHost {...}
	          ...
	  }

2011-04-08  Andras Varga

	* implemented conditional submodules, see nedxml/ChangeLog for details

2011-02-23  ------ omnetpp-4.2b1 released ------

2010-02-17  Andras Varga

	* fix: deep parameter assignments containing parameter references
	or the "index" operator were evaluated in the wrong context (in the
	context of the module whose parameter was assigned, instead of the
	context where the expression occurred in the code).

2010-06-11  ------ omnetpp-4.1 released ------

2010-05-31  ------ omnetpp-4.1rc2 released ------

2010-04-20  ------ omnetpp-4.1b4 released ------

2010-04-19  Andras Varga

	* implemented submodule @dynamic property: submodules declared dynamic
	(with @dynamic() or @dynamic(true)) will not be instantiated
	automatically, it is expected that they will be created at runtime
	by other modules. However, they can still be graphically edited in the
	IDE, and the ini file editor can provide content assist for setting
	their parameters.

2010-03-14  ------ omnetpp-4.1b3 released ------

2009-01-27 Andras Varga

	* fix: when subclassing from a compound module, parameter assignments
	in the super type's "submodules" block did not take effect

2009-xx-xx Andras Varga

	* INCOMPATIBLE NED SEMANTICS CHANGE 4.0:
	    fixed parameter values CANNOT be overwritten from subclasses or submodule sections
	         (this is for consistency with pattern assignments)

2009-03-12  ------ omnetpp-4.0 released ------

2009-02-27  ------ omnetpp-4.0rc2 released ------

2008-12-12  ------ omnetpp-4.0rc1 released ------

2005-09-12  Andras Varga

	* fix in loadnedfile.cc [reported by Johnny Lai]

2005-08-08  Andras Varga

	* cnednetworkbuilder.cc: assign submodule parameters, gatesizes etc
	in that submodule's context (use cContextSwitcher); same for network.
	This is mainly needed for ModNameParamResolver to work correctly
	($MODULE_NAME etc for XPath expressions are taken from the module
	in context).

2005-08-07  Andras Varga

	* cnednetworkbuilder.cc: don't look for module type if module vector
	size is zero

2005-07-26  Andras Varga

	* cnednetworkbuilder.cc: didn't check gate directions on connecting

2005-04-08  Andras Varga
