	* added named connections support (both explicit connection name, and
	@defaultname channel type property; see the manual for details)

	* "type-name" per-object config option has been renamed to "typename",
	for consistency with NED. (It is now an exception to the rule that
	all per-object options have a hyphen in their names.)

2011-04-19  Andras Varga

	* implemented "typename" patterns, a way of assigning type to
	parametric submodule types without using parameters. The syntax
	is like deep parameter assignments, where the last component of
	the pattern is ".typename". Rules are the same as with deep param
	assignments: the innermost matching pattern with a non-default
	value will be effective; and default value can be overridden,
	i.e. the outermost pattern with a default(...) value will be the
	actual default (that becomes effective when the inifile does not
	specify a value via **.type-name). "typename" is not accepted in the
	body of the parametric submodule itself, because the value expression
	would have to be evaluated in the context of a submodule that
	does not exist yet.

	Example:
	  network Net {
	      parameters:
	          server.tcp.typename = "TCP_NSC";
	          host*.tcp.typename = default("TCP_lwIP");
	      submodule:
	          server: StandardHost {...}
	          ...
	  }

	* implemented conditional submodules, see nedxml/ChangeLog for details

2011-02-23  ------ omnetpp-4.2b1 released ------

2010-02-17  Andras Varga

	* fix: deep parameter assignments containing parameter references
	or the "index" operator were evaluated in the wrong context (in the
	context of the module whose parameter was assigned, instead of the
	context where the expression occurred in the code).

2010-04-19  Andras Varga

	* implemented submodule @dynamic property: submodules declared dynamic
	(with @dynamic() or @dynamic(true)) will not be instantiated
	automatically, it is expected that they will be created at runtime
	by other modules. However, they can still be graphically edited in the
	IDE, and the ini file editor can provide content assist for setting
	their parameters.

	* fix: when subclassing from a compound module, parameter assignments
	in the super type's "submodules" block did not take effect

2009-xx-xx Andras Varga

	* INCOMPATIBLE NED SEMANTICS CHANGE 4.0:
            fixed parameter values CANNOT be overwritten from subclasses or submodule sections
                 (this is for consistency with pattern assignments)

	* fix in loadnedfile.cc [reported by Johnny Lai]

2005-08-08  Andras Varga

	* cnednetworkbuilder.cc: assign submodule parameters, gatesizes etc
	in that submodule's context (use cContextSwitcher); same for network.
	This is mainly needed for ModNameParamResolver to work correctly
	($MODULE_NAME etc for XPath expressions are taken from the module
	in context).

2005-08-07  Andras Varga

	* cnednetworkbuilder.cc: don't look for module type if module vector
	size is zero

2005-07-26  Andras Varga

	* cnednetworkbuilder.cc: didn't check gate directions on connecting

2005-04-08  Andras Varga
