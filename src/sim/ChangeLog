	* Fix: proper namespace resolution for C++ types in @signal declarations.
	This fixes signals_namespace1.test.

2022-08-17  Andras Varga

	* Feature: added cProperty::getValueOriginFile(), getValueOriginType()

2022-06-17  Attila Torok

	* Check for context component in all built-in NED functions that need it,
	and throw an exception if there is none, instead of just crashing. This
	is needed when evaluating expressions in display strings of messages.

2022-05-18  Attila Torok

	* build: Disable implicit make rules by setting .SUFFIXES to empty

	* Fix build by including <memory> for std::unique_ptr

2022-04-11  ------ omnetpp-6.0 released ------

2022-04-07  Andras Varga

	* intuniform(): ensure range (b-a) is supported by the RNG; and avoid
	spurious signed<->unsigned conversions which are supposed to be unspecified behavior.

2022-04-07  Andras Varga

	* intuniform()/intuniformexcl): enforce a<=b or a<b

2022-04-06  Andras Varga

	* cDynamicExpression: fix memory leak

2022-04-05  Andras Varga

	* cKSplit: quick fix for memory leak in iteratorToCell()

2022-04-05  Andras Varga

	* Reworked the initialization of the global cSoftOwner instance
	globalOwningContext, due to issues found by UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer.

	The problem was that globalOwningContext sort of wanted it insert itself
	into its own child list while being constructed. It sort of worked but
	the sanitizer sniffed out something was off.

	The reworked solution employs a separate dedicated constructor which
	avoids the owningContext->doInsert(this) call. internal::Void is a type
	solely made to distinguish the dedicated constructor from other
	constructors by giving it a different signature.

2022-04-05  Andras Varga

	* Fix invalid value for LogLevel error from sanitizer

2022-03-19  Andras Varga

	* Resolve lifecycle listener crash on shutdown.

2022-04-05  Andras Varga

	* Replace memcpy() with std::copy_n(), to avoid calling memcpy() with
	nullptr as 2nd arg, even with size=0.

2022-04-05  Andras Varga

	* SimTime: avoid overflow in fillPowersOfTen()

2021-12-07  Andras Varga

	* Result recorders: suppressed the ", vector" suffix from titles of
	vector results. Also "histogram" and "stats". They don't need to be added,
	as they are obvious, they simply echo the result item type.

2021-11-30  Andras Varga

	* cResultRecorder: save display names and recording mode as result
	attributes and "recordingmode", "moduledisplaypath".

2021-12-03  Andras Varga

	* Move displayName field from cModule to cComponent

2021-11-25  Andras Varga

	* cModule: fix: allow accessing module parameters from the "display-name"
	config options.

2021-11-25  Andras Varga

	* cConfiguration: Allow expressions in config option values to use
	NED operators, module parameters and other NED expression features.
	Immediate motivation: to be able use e.g. index in display-name:
	**.app[0..3].display-name = "cbr-" + string(index)

2021-11-17  Andras Varga

	* Result filters: Let the "count" and "sum" filter to record an
	initial zero value.

	- reuse cResultFilter::getInitialDoubleValue() for that
	- timestamp must be the end of the warmup period, otherwise plot will lie
	- emit after network building is done
	- dynamically created modules must be taken into account

2021-11-24  Andras Varga

	* SumPerDurationFilter: fix getSumPerDuration() behavior when invoked
	during warmup period.

2021-11-08  Andras Varga

	* cModule: displayName fix: getDisplayName() docu promises nullptr if unset

2021-11-04  Andras Varga

	* cPar: Implemented isMutable() and the mechanism behind the new @mutable
	property. @mutable may annotate module/channel parameters in NED, and has
	the effect that non-mutable parameters (those without @mutable) cannot be
	changed at runtime. It is recommended to only mark those parameters with
	@mutable whose change actually takes effect during simulation, e.g. are
	handled in handleParameterChange() methods in simple modules. The presence
	of @mutable conveys the info which parameters can be tweaked to users of the
	module.

	Add parameter-mutability-check=false to omnetpp.ini to disable the check
	for models that don't have the necessary @mutable annotations added.

2021-07-11  Andras Varga

	* Follow change: moved internal classes to the omnetpp::internal namespace.

2021-11-02  Andras Varga

	* Nits related to ownership handling:
	  - cObject::yieldOwnership() shouldn't crash in the "throw" statement
	    when newOwner==nullptr
	  - Set name of cTemporaryOwner objects to "tmp"
	  - Set name of globalOwningContext object to "globalOwningContext"
	  - etc.

2021-11-04  Andras Varga

	* Introduced cValueContainer as common base class for cValueHolder,
	cValueArray, cValueMap.

2021-11-02  Andras Varga

	* cValueMap/cValueArray: revert dup() to behave the same way
	cArray/cQueue does, i.e. only duplicate those objects that are
	owned by the cloned container. This doesn't make much of a difference,
	but some NED expressions that have been accepted now cause an error.
	You need to dup the VERY object that belongs to some other owner --
	dupping its container is NOT good any more. For example:

	    foo = {};
	    bar = dup([foo,foo]);  // error
	    bar = [dup(foo), dup(foo)]  // OK

2021-11-04  Andras Varga

	* cObjectParImpl: added hint to "not owner" error message: "Try cloning it
	using the dup() function!"

2021-11-04  Andras Varga

	* Make unused parsimPack()/parsimUnpack() to be less of a noise

2021-11-03  Andras Varga

	* getModuleByPath() / findModuleByPath() moved to cComponent

2021-11-03  Andras Varga

	* cResultFilter/cResultRecorder: suppress expected warnings

2021-11-01  Andras Varga

	* cObjectParImpl: More thorough check of the assigned content
	wrt object ownership. Only fully owned cOwnedObjects are allowed.

2021-11-01  Andras Varga

	* Added the expr() operator to NED. expr() can be used to specify
	an expression with free variables. For example, assigning expr(x+y)
	to a module parameter of type object allows the module implementation
	to query the expression (it will be a cOwnedDynamicExpression object),
	bind the free variables (e.g. x=3,y=2), and evaluate it. The expr()
	operator is useful for e.g. implementing arbitrary packet filters.

	* Added the new cOwnedDynamicExpression class, needed for expr().

2021-10-27  Andras Varga

	* Added cValueHolder.

	* cValueArray, cValueMap: Fix: errors for stored non-cObject pointers

2021-10-18  Andras Varga

	* Fix call to wrong (deprecated) cResultFilter::init() method in
	StatisticSourceAstTranslator.

2021-10-11  Andras Varga

	* Added MergeFilter, a cResultFilter that allows multiple inputs,
	and multiplexes them onto its singe output. It is available (as the
	merge() function) in the source= part of @statistic, but not in the
	record= part.

2021-10-08  Andras Varga

	* Follow change: cResultFilter, cResultRecorder init() args merged
	into a Context struct.

2021-10-06  Andras Varga

	* Follow changes: Introduction of txid_t and msgid_t; changes in the cRNG
	interface.

2021-09-23  Andras Varga

	* Component parameters (specially JSON values) made more editable

2021-09-30  Andras Varga

	* sim_std.msg: removed some @descriptor(readonly) annotations

2021-09-30  Andras Varga

	* sim_std.msg: fix: simtime_t fields were not editable.
	Also made other @opaque classes editable: cFigure::Point,
	cFigure::Rectangle, cFigure::Transform, cFigure::Color, cFigure::Font

2021-09-22  Andras Varga

	* DemuxFilter: move demux label to the front of the result name string

2021-09-22  Andras Varga

	* Fix: according to its descriptor, cObject didn't have a "name" field

2021-06-09  Attila Torok

	* cSimulation: Add sanity check to prevent reentrant event execution

2021-09-13  Andras Varga

	* Fix bug introduced in 6.0pre12: "undisposed object" message didn't
	contain the full path of parent module, only its name.

2021-07-29  Andras Varga

	* cProperty: implement changes, see include/ChangeLog for details.

2021-07-16  Andras Varga

	* sim_std.msg: added @toValue()/@fromValue annotations

2021-07-20  Andras Varga

	* cClassDescriptor: added getFieldValue()/setFieldValue() to allow
	accessing fields using cValue

2021-07-08  Andras Varga

	* cValue changed to hold any_ptr instead of cObject (see include/ChangeLog
	for details).

2021-07-17  Andras Varga

	* cPar: added cValue-based generic access: getValue(), setValue()

021-07-08  Andras Varga

	* cHistogram: added str() to Bin, and use it in sim_std.msg

2021-07-07  Rudolf Hornig

	* build: copy sim_std_m.h to the include/omnetpp directory as it is
	now #included into <omnetpp.h>

2021-07-06  Andras Varga

	* sim_std.msg adjustments (over multiple commits

	- cplusplus(cc) part: move stuff from .h to .cc because it's only needed
	  by the class descriptors

	- mark non-polymorphic classes with @polymorphic(false); this results in
	  simpler toAnyPtr() code (i.e. without the dynamic_cast part)

	- cResultListener inheritance fixed to match reality

	- use @castFunction(false) to turn off generating fromAnyPtr/toAnyPtr
	  functions for some classes that have it defined elsewhere

	- wrong base class was given for a few classes

	- StringVector was unused, removed

2021-07-06  Andras Varga

	* Port the codebase to any_ptr:

	- "if (p)" changed to "if (p != nullptr)" everywhere, because any_ptr
	  intentionally has no bool conversion, but can be directly compared
	  against nullpr.

	- use fromAnyPtr()/toAnyPtr() everywhere for conversion from/to any_ptr

2021-06-28  Andras Varga

	* Follow change: cClassDescriptor now uses any_ptr instead of void*.

2021-06-23  Andras Varga

	* Added implementation of any_ptr.

2021-07-01  Zoltan Bojthe

	* cValueArray: add asIntVectorInUnit(), asDoubleVectorInUnit()
	functions

2021-07-01  Zoltan Bojthe

	* cValueArray: fixed copy-paste bug (type mismatch)

2021-06-23  Andras Varga

	* Error messages reworded to be more precise:
	"Cannot evaluate expression for parameter '%s'" --> "Cannot assign
	parameter '%s'"

	The old message was misleading, because often the expression itself evaluates
	just fine, only the result is of the wrong type and cannot be assigned to
	the parameter.

2021-06-07  Attila Torok

	* Add proxy class descriptor for WATCH_[OBJ|PTR] to avoid crashes

	The original solution involving:
	virtual cClassDescriptor *cWatch_cObject::getDescriptor() const override
	{return r.getDescriptor();} didn't work because the cWatch subclasses
	lied that they themselves can be described by the descriptors of the
	watched objects, which is not true.

	And since there is often a cast through a void* in the descriptor APIs,
	this mismatch went unnoticed, and operated essentially as a
	reinterpret_cast, so mostly garbage was shown on the GUI as field values,
	until eventually a crash occurred.

	See test/anim/watch for an example.

2021-06-23  Andras Varga

	* cModule: implemented addSubmodule() method

2021-06-23  Andras Varga

	* cModuleType: createScheduleInit() adjusted to allow creating
	vector elements

2021-06-23  Andras Varga

	* cModuleType: create() merge two overloads

2021-06-23  Andras Varga

	* cModule: addGate(): creation of gate vectors moved out to
	addGateVector()

2021-06-18  Andras Varga

	* cStringPool removed

2021-06-20  Andras Varga

	* cStaticFlag refactoring

2021-06-16  Andras Varga

	* cNedNetworkBuilder: report location for evaluation errors in
	parameter values set from NED files

2021-06-17  Andras Varga

	* Follow changes in 'include/': Use opp_pooledstring/opp_staticpooledstring
	throughout the library.

2021-06-12  Andras Varga

	* Follow changes in 'include/': added opp_pooledstring, opp_staticpooledstring

2021-06-13  Andras Varga

	* cParImpl::parse() to store the expression's origin (file:line) in
	cDynamicExpression so  we can report it on evaluation errors.

2021-06-15  Andras Varga

	* cRuntimeError: Implemented ctor for helping chaining exceptions

2021-06-15  Andras Varga

	* cException modernized

2021-06-09  Andras Varga

	* Implemented cConfiguration::KeyValue::getSourceLocation(),
	so we can report location for parse errors in values coming
	from ini files.

2021-06-18  Andras Varga

	* cModule: simplify storing fullPath.

2021-06-18  Andras Varga

	* cNamedObject: fix setName(getName())

2021-06-13  Andras Varga

	* nedfunctions: get() NED function refined

2021-06-17  Andras Varga

	* Follow header change: more methods made const in cPatternMatcher,
	cMatchExpression and cTopology

2021-06-17  Andras Varga

	* Fix: @omittedTypename didn't work if interface was not in the
	default (=toplevel) package

2021-06-11  Andras Varga

	* cValueArray, cValueMap: dup() to make an "even deeper" copy (clone
	ALL objects). This is necessary for the following NED to work:

	   object a = {};
	   object b = dup([a]);

2021-06-09  Andras Varga

	* nedfunctions: added get(), size(), dup() NED functions

2021-06-10  Andras Varga

	* nedsupport: search for function/methods by the number of args

	On one hand, this allows overloads by the number of args.

	On the other hand, we cannot be as specific with error messages as
	before. Instead of

	   "NED function '%s' expects %d arguments",

	we'll report

	   "A '%s' function that accepts %d argument(s) was not found",

	regardless of whether a function with that name but accepting a different
	number of args exists or not.

2021-06-10  Andras Varga

	* cNedFunction: added search by name AND accepted number of args

	New functions:
	- bool acceptsArgCount(int argCount)
	- static cNedFunction *find(const char *name, int argCount)
	- static cNedFunction *get(const char *name, int argCount)

2021-06-10  Andras Varga

	* NED: implemented Universal Function Call Syntax

	f(x,..) and x.f(...) are now equivalent. All NED functions that have at
	least one argument can be used with the method syntax as well.

	See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Function_Call_Syntax

2021-06-08  Andras Varga

	* Allow 'object' as NED function arg type and return type

	Disallow objects shared among parameters, because we don't know their
	lifetimes.

	Example:
	  object a = [1,2,3];
	  object b = a;

	then set 'a' to nullptr --> accessing 'b' would crash!

2021-06-09  Andras Varga

	* NED builder: allow the body of a parametric submodule to assign
	apparently nonexistent parameters.

	Example:

	        app: <default("FooApp")> like IApp {
	           parameters:
	               address = parent.address;
	               sleepTime = 1s;
	       }

	If FooApp has a sleepTime parameter but IApp does not, then running with
	the defaults is fine, but changing to another IApp type that does NOT
	have a sleepTime parameter will stop the simulation with an error.

	Solution: inside a parameteric submodule type, we simply ignore parameter
	assignments that assign nonexistent parameters.

2021-06-09  Andras Varga

	* NED builder: fix parametric channel type with type given as default
	expression. The expression text was mistakenly interpreted as parameter name.

	Example:
	   a.out++ --> <default(channelType+"")> like IFooChannel --> b.in++;

	It would give the following error:

	    Error: Unknown parameter '"bubu"+channelType+""'

2021-06-09  Andras Varga

	* nedsupport: give name strings to cValueArray and cValueMap objects
	created for JSON arrays and maps: "array%d", "map%d". This can help
	identify them in error messages, etc.

2021-06-11  Andras Varga

	* cValueMap: fix copy ctor and dup()

2021-06-09  Andras Varga

	* cValue: operator==() added

2021-06-08  Andras Varga

	* cDynamicExpression: fix an ownership issue during evaluation

2021-06-09  Andras Varga

	* cComponentType: delete shared cParImpl instances at the end of the
	simulation. Previously they were only deleted on program exit.

2021-06-07  Andras Varga

	* nedsupport: exists() NED operator to accept more forms.

	Esp. testing for submodule vector elements. This is necessary because
	submodule vectors may now contain holes (due to @omittedTypename)

2021-06-04  Andras Varga

	* Actually fire cPreModuleAddNotification before *adding* the module,
	not before creating it. Contents also changed accordingly.

2021-06-04  Attila Torok

	* Fix crash of cModule::changeParentTo(). Inside reassignModuleIdRec(),
	deregisterComponent() resets the stored simulation pointer to nullptr,
	causing simulation->registerComponent() to crash.

2021-05-31  Andras Varga

	* NED: implemented @omittedTypename property + test

	@omittedTypename allows one to specify a NED type to use when typename=""
	is specified for a parametric submodule or channel, or to remove (skip
	creating) that submodule, submodule vector element, or channel
	altogether.

	@omittedTypename can be specified on a module interface or channel
	interface, or on a submodule or connection. It should contain a single
	(optional) value. The value names the type to use. If it is absent, the
	submodule or channel will not be created. (The connection will be created
	without a channel object.)

2021-06-03  Andras Varga

	* cNedNetworkBuilder: remove unused parameter 'isSubcomponent'

2021-06-01  Andras Varga

	* Error message wording refined:

	"Cannot evaluate parameter %s" --> "Cannot evaluate expression for
	parameter %s"
	"Wrong value '%s' for parameter '%s'" --> "Error in expression '%s' for
	parameter '%s'"

2021-05-26  Andras Varga

	* nedsupport: changed the meaning of unqualified parameter, gate and
	submodule accesses; exists(), index and sizeof() reimplemented accordingly.

	Within a submodule's or channel's curly brace block, a plain identifier
	('foo') no longer refers to the compound module's parameter, but to the
	local parameter. Similarly, another submodule must now be referenced with
	the 'parent' qualifier.

	Also, the 'index' and 'typename' operators now accept more variants.

2021-05-05  Andras Varga

	* Delete "inComponentScope", rudimentary support for "parent.something" syntax

2021-05-26  Andras Varga

	* cGate, cModule: use opp_indexedname() for producing module/gate full names

2021-05-30  Andras Varga

	* cComponent/cModule: keep lastCompletedInitStage; fix initialization
	w/ dynamic module creation.

	Initialization works again if submodules are created/deleted during
	iteration. SubmoduleIterator is restarted if creation/deletion is
	detected during iteration; modules already initialized in the previous
	round are recognized and skipped with the help of lastCompletedInitStage.

2021-05-28  Andras Varga

	* SubmoduleIterator: keep NED order of modules; detect modifications
	during iteration.

	Solution: We use two cursors: one on scalars plus one on vectors, and
	always take the one created earlier (smaller module ID); exploiting the
	fact that scalars are stored in creation order, and vectors are created
	(and filled) by NED as they occur in NED files.

	This breaks models where submodules are created/deleted during
	initialization: exception will be thrown (submodule list changed during
	iteration). This is fixed in a later commit.

2021-05-27  Andras Varga

	* cModule: ensure unique submodule names.

2021-05-27  Andras Varga

	* cModule: added setIndex() and setNameAndIndex(); added ASSERTs to
	cSimulation

2021-05-25  Andras Varga

	* NED: exists(): answer true for zero-size submodule vectors

2021-05-19  Andras Varga

	* sizeof(): error if there's no such submodule or gate vector

2021-05-21  Andras Varga

	* cModule, cGate: getIndex(), getVectorSize(), gateSize() etc to throw
	for non-vector submodules/gates.

2021-05-25  Andras Varga

	* cModule: added hasSubmodule(), getSubmoduleNames(), hasGateVector(),
	hasGates()

	Reason:
	- hasSubmodule() because hasGate() also exists
	- getSubmoduleNames() because getGateNames() also exists
	- hasGateVector() because hasSubmoduleVector() also exists
	- hasGates() because hasSubmodules() also exists
	- ALSO: getGateNames(): return type changed from std::string<const char*>
	 to std::vector<std::string>, for consistency with getSubmoduleNames()

2021-05-19  Andras Varga

	* cModule: keep track of submodule vectors; store submodules in
	pointer arrays. See include/omnetpp/ChangeLog for details.

2021-05-25  Andras Varga

	* cComponent: added getNedTypeAndFullName() and getNedTypeAndFullPath()

	They are especially useful in constructing error messages in NED
	functions (e.g. nedsupport.cc).

2021-05-21  Andras Varga

	* cXMLElement etc: do not call getIndex() and getVectorSize() on
	non-vector module

	cXMLElement change: resolve $MODULE_INDEX, $PARENTMODULE_NAME and similar
	variables to empty string if they are not applicable. Make resolve()
	return 'true' for them, otherwise the mini XPath interpreter will report
	them as unknown variables. Especially, DO NOT THROW exception.

	Also: use std::to_string(int) instead of local function my_itostr().

2021-05-11  Andras Varga

	* NED: Added CSV/JSON parsing/reading NED functions:

	- parseCSV(), readCSV()
	- parseExtendedCSV(), readExtendedCSV()
	- parseJSON(), readJSON()
	- parseExtendedJSON(), readExtendedJSON()
	- parseXML(), readXML() -- they are aliases to the existing
	   xml()/xmldoc() functions (or rather, the other way round)

2021-05-12  Andras Varga

	* Implemented functions in newly created stringutil.h; most functions
	just delegate to common/stringutil.h

2021-05-11  Andras Varga

	* cStringTokenizer rewritten as a wrapper around common::StringTokenizer.

2021-05-13  Andras Varga

	* Cosmetics on '// namespace' comments

2021-05-03  Andras Varga

	* New NED functions: readFile(), eval(), plus filesystem related ones:
	workingDir(), baseDir(), concatDirAndFile(), absFilePath()

2021-05-04  Andras Varga

	* cDynamicExpression: parseNedExpr(): eliminate unused legacy inInifile
	argument

2021-05-04  Andras Varga

	* cNedFunction: modernizing: use proper enum instead of chars for arg types

2021-05-04  Andras Varga

	* cNedFunction: fix bogus error message

2021-05-07  Andras Varga

	* Follow change: contextType changed from int to enum

2021-04-29  Andras Varga

	* Move lifecycle-related methods into cEnvir; they were independently
	implemented in EnvirBase, cNullEnvir, StaticEnv. Added
	getLifecycleListeners().

2021-04-15  Attila Torok

	* Fix a couple format-string related bugs when constructing cRuntimeError

2021-04-16  Andras Varga

	* cValue: print double quantities in the "best" unit if outside the
	"easy-to-read" range

2021-04-15  Andras Varga

	* cValueArray: fix type specifier in format string

2021-04-15  Andras Varga

	* Resolve compile-time warning about throwing from destructor

2021-04-09  Andras Varga

	* cStringPool: use std::unordered_map instead of std::map, for better performance.

2021-04-08  Andras Varga

	* cComponent: Turn on name pooling for modules and channels.
	This results in saving some memory. E.g. in INET, the same names occur in
	each host/router; now they are stored in one copy only. The price is a
	small extra runtime cost at network build time.

2021-04-08  Andras Varga

	* cModule: use stringpooling for full name. This results in conserving
	memory if similarly-named submodule vectors occur among several modules,
	in exchange for a (small) extra cost during network setup. E.g consider
	that names like "app[0]" or "eth[0]" occur in many hosts in an INET
	simulation; now such strings are stored in one copy only.

2021-04-07  Andras Varga

	* cModule: namePool renamed to gateNamePool

2021-04-08  Andras Varga

	* cVisitor: implement/follow changes:

	- visit(cObject *obj) changed from void to bool
	- EndTraversalException removed
	- existing visitor classes and forEachChild() methods updated accordingly

2021-04-07  Andras Varga

	* cDefaultMessagePrinter: support for new columns: TxUpdate, Durations,
	Length, Info. This makes it possible to see in Qtenv's packet log if
	a packet is a transmission update (except if the simulation installs
	its own packet printer like INET does).

2021-03-29  Andras Varga

	* cComponent: Added "display-string" config option. This allows specifying
	(or contributing to) display strings from the configuration.

2021-03-27  Andras Varga

	* cModule: implemented display name support, including a new "display-name"
	config option.

2021-03-23  Andras Varga

	* cObjectParImpl: Resolve "undisposed object" when checkType() throws.
	First install the new object (assign 'obj'), then check.

2021-03-23  Andras Varga

	* cPar::setExpression(), cPar::parse(): Ensure that expressions for
	non-volatile parameters are evaluated immediately.

	Motivation: When an expression was entered for a non-volatile parameter
	in Qtenv's Object Inspector, it was stored as an expression (instead of
	being evaluated).

2021-03-23  Andras Varga

	* cPar::setObjectValue(): Fix failing assertion.

2021-02-16  Andras Varga

	* cObjectParImpl: Fix: forEachChild() should not be a state-changing
	operation

	An objectValue() call, if the parameter contains an expression, would
	re-evaluate the expression and delete the previously returned object
	while storing the new object into 'obj'. This crashed Qtenv's Object
	Inspector, because it tried to use the old pointer (namely, tried to get
	a cClassDescriptor for it), not suspecting that collecting the object's
	children via forEachChild() would delete the object.

	The solution is basically that forEach() doesn't recurse into the value
	produced by volatile parameters, which kinda makes sense
	(they are volatile).

	Same for cXMLParImpl.

2020-12-10  Levente Mészáros

	* cSimpleModule::scheduleAt(): Swapped the insertion into the FES and the
	EVCB.messageScheduled(msg) calls.

	This way the self message is already in the FES when the EVCB call
	happens, which actually makes sense because it's called messageScheduled().
	The reason was that the eventlog file manager thought that the message was
	not scheduled.

2020-12-18  Andras Varga

	* cSoftOwner::ownedObjectDeleted(): re-enabled "Context component
	is deleting an object it doesn't own" warning. When it is in the way,
	it can now be disabled with the new "allow-object-stealing-on-deletion"
	config option.

2021-02-12  Andras Varga

	* cPar: Notify (call handleParameterChange()) during initialize() as
	well. The handleParameter(nullptr) call at the end of the initialization
	was removed. NOTE: if a model relied on the handleParameter(nullptr)
	call being made, it needs to be updated!

2021-02-19  Andras Varga

	* cValue: prevent doubleValue() to be called on a value with unit --
	too error-prone.

	cValue(10s)->doubleValue() --> 10 cValue(10us)->doubleValue() --> 10
	cValue(10h)->doubleValue() --> 10

	Solution: doubleValue() to throw exception when called on a value with
	unit. In the value has a unit, call either doubleValueInUnit(), or
	doubleValueRaw()+getUnit(). Same for intValue()

2021-03-09  Andras Varga

	* sim_std.msg: Fix add missing cPar::Type::OBJECT.

2021-03-05  Andras Varga

	* cValueArray and cValueMap not to take random temp objects.

2021-03-05  Andras Varga

	* nedsupport: make use of new ArrayNode/ObjectNode classes in common/.

2021-03-04  Andras Varga

	* cParImpl classes: make sure value cObjects are not leaked in the
	"Cannot cast..." error case.

2021-03-04  Andras Varga

	* cDynamicExpression: gc temp objects created during evaluation.

2021-03-04  Andras Varga

	* cTemporaryOwner: refactored, its file renamed. Added destructor modes.

2021-03-04  Andras Varga

	* cTemporaryObject: yield() renamed to restoreOrginalOwner().

2021-03-04  Andras Varga

	* cSoftOwner: remove get/setPerformFinalGC(). It was meant for internal
	use, and pretty much unused.

2021-03-03  Andras Varga

	* cXMLParImpl: str() to return "nullptr" for nullptr instead of "".

2021-03-03  Andras Varga

	* cBoolParImpl: Fix error message.

2021-03-04  Andras Varga

	* cDynamicExpression: The sim library needs to call
	ExprValue::setObjectStrFunction() on startup.

2021-03-03  Andras Varga

	* Improved cast-related error messages when assigning parameters:

	  - added E_BADASSIGN
	  - change E_BADCAST message to include the "from" type
	  - merged E_ECANTCAST into E_BADCAST (they were essentially the same)

2021-03-02  Andras Varga

	* cValue: Better handing for the "undefined" value.

2021-02-11  Andras Varga

	* cPathFigure: path parsing refined: if op character is missing, assume
	previous one.

2021-02-04  Edward Longman

	* cAutoRangeHistogramStrategy: Work around double limits of precision.

2021-02-03  Edward Longman

	* cDefaultHistogramStrategy: Fix for very small values of rangeMax.

2020-12-18  Andras Varga

	* Fix: during deleteModule(), call emit() in the right context.

2020-12-18  Andras Varga

	* cSoftOwner::ownedObjectDeleted(): Temporarily disable "Context component
	is deleting an object it doesn't own" warning. We plan to put it back after
	more careful preparation in models like INET.

2020-12-15  Andras Varga

	* cSimulation::loadNedSourceFolder(): accept exclusions in the form of
	packages instead of folders.

2020-12-09  Andras Varga

	* cObject: implemented getClassAndFullPath(), getClassAndFullName().

2020-12-09  Andras Varga

	* cComponent: Introduced callPreDelete() for invoking preDelete(); move recursion
	out of preDelete(). See include/ChangeLog for rationale.

2020-12-07  Andras Varga

	* Prevent one module from being able to silently delete another module's
	message. ("Context component is deleting an object it doesn't own" error.)
	Solution: only the context module is allowed to delete objects.

2020-12-06  Andras Varga

	* Ownership refactoring: Introduce and use cTemporaryOwningContext
	where appropriate.

2020-12-02  Levente Meszaros

	* Follow renames related to the automatic ownership mechanism:
	cDefaultOwner -> cSoftOwner, defaultOwner -> owningContext, etc.
	See include/ChangeLog for details.

2020-12-04  Attila Torok

	* Fingerprint: Include the alignment of text figures in their hash.

2020-11-26  Attila Torok

	* cFigure, cAbstractTextFigure: Implemented text alignment support.

2020-11-25  Andras Varga

	* Follow cFigure::RGBA and cFigure::Pixmap changes

2020-11-13  Attila Torok

	* Modernizing: Use in-class member initializers wherever possible;
	use "=default" syntax for copy constructors where appropriate.
	Tool: clang-tidy plus manual editing where needed.

2020-11-11  Andras Varga

	* cFigure: Hashing refinements:
	  1. Cache figure hash for better performance.
	  2. Merge hashGeometry() and hashGeometryRec(), and rename it hashTo().
	  3. Exclude invisible figure subtrees from hash.
	  4. Include ALL hashable properties (not just geometry) into the hash.

2020-11-11  Andras Varga

	* cHasher: fix #846 "cHasher::add - correction & optimisation".
	Since chars were signed, converting p[i] to uint32_t does sign extension
	which is bad because we "or" such values together.

2020-10-10  Andras Varga

	* Removed support for USE_OMNETPP4x_FINGERPRINTS.

2020-09-10  Andras Varga

	* cComponent: added preDelete()

2020-10-17  Andras Varga

	* Change for opp_component_ptr: cComponent::~cComponent() to null out
	all pointers that point to that component.

2020-10-12  Andras Varga

	* send() should NOT use the transmissionId already on the packet, ever.
	It must now be explicitly specified in SendOptions for the original
	packet and for updates, too.

2020-10-13  Rudolf Hornig

	* Moved debug trap macro to the same line as the call to handleMessage().
	This is useful because you have to press Step Into only once
	(instead of twice) when stopped in the debugger.

2020-10-11  Andras Varga

	* Transmission updates API: origPacketId renamed to transmissionId.

	Related changes:
	- isUpdate() now uses separate flag
	- for the original packets, transmissionId is implicitly taken from the
	  message ID

2020-09-24  Rudolf Hornig

	* build: on Windows, create .dll.a import libraries for shared libs.

	To work with LLD linker, proper import libs must exists as
	'autoimporting' is not supported with LLD for example. Also,
	autoimporting/exporting is problematic because the number of exported
	symbols must not exceed 65536 in a single DLL and exporting all symbols
	can easily overwhelm the linker.

2020-09-27  Andras Varga

	* cDatarateChannel: implemented mode=MULTI. It allows multiple concurrent
	transmissions, with consistency checking, isBusy(), getTransmissionFinishTime(),
	and channelBusy signal support.

2020-09-27  Andras Varga

	* cDatarateChannel: packet-handling part of processMessage() factored
	out as processPacket().

2020-09-27  Andras Varga

	* cDatarateChannel: refactor: group together packet-related operations.

2020-09-18  Andras Varga

	* cDatarateChannel: allow multiple concurrent transmissions, without
	any checks/bookkeeping. Set mode=UNCHECKED for that.

	Note: cDatarateChannel::finish() was moved to the bottom of the file.

2020-09-11  Andras Varga

	* cModule: deleteModule() refactoring.

	It is not supposed to do stuff (like fire pre-model-change notifications)
	from a halfway-deleted module. Now we do every risky thing (such as
	deleting submodules and disconnecting gates) from doDeleteModule(), and
	only delete the module object when it is already barebones (no
	submodules, gates, listeners, etc).

	The deletion sequence is now pretty much the reverse of the setup
	sequence.

2020-09-08  Andras Varga

	* cDatarateChannel::processMessage() rewritten for clarity.

2020-08-12  Andras Varga

	* IdentityFilter: Do not convert signal values to numeric.

2020-08-28  Levente Mészáros

	* Moved default operator<< to cObject and added printOn().

2020-08-27  Andras Varga

	* cIListener destructor to unsubscribe from all places, instead of
	insisting on being already unsubscribed. This fixes the issue
	introduced in the previous commit.

2020-08-14  Andras Varga

	* cModule: Change module destruction sequence, so that when deleting
	a compound module, the compound module's local listeners are notified
	about the deletion of the submodules.

	The downside is that more listeners now need to be explicitly
	unsubscribed
	(listeners MUST NOT be subscribed anywhere when they are destructed,
	cIListener's destructor contains an assertion for that). Due to this
	change, signals_modelchange_1.test currently breaks (error during network
	teardown).

2020-08-26  Andras Varga

	* cModule: deleteModule() moved right below the destructor.
	For editing convenience, as the two work in tandem (modules may only be
	deleted via deleteModule().

2020-08-14  Levente Mészáros

	* Fixed clone in result filter/recorder to use init().

2020-08-10  Andras Varga

	* Added DemuxFilter. Needed changes:
	- cResultListener: clone() method added
	- Register_ResultRecorder() impl changed to allow creating
	  filters/recorders with createOne(); this is needed by clone()
	- cResultFilter: init() to store component and attrsProperty, because
	  clone() needs them
	- cResultListener: receiveSignal() methods need to be public so that
	   DemuxFilter can call them.
	- cResultRecorder: added setDemuxLabel(), needed as part of result names

2020-07-21  Andras Varga

	* cSimpleModule: added rescheduleAt(), rescheduleAfter()

	Note1: cancelEvent() is quite tolerant (it doesn't complain if event is
	NOT scheduled), and since rescheduleAt()/rescheduleAfter() are primarily
	utility methods, they inherit this behavior.

	Note2: it is possible to implement rescheduling methods more efficiently
	than cancelEvent+scheduleAt. This is not yet done in this patch.

2020-07-20  Andras Varga

	* cSimpleModule: added scheduleAfter()

2020-07-29  Andras Varga

	* Cosmetics in cSimpleModule: rename local vars:
	newMsg -> receivedMessage, starter -> starterMessage.

2020-07-29  Andras Varga

	* msgForActivity moved from cSimulation to cSimpleModule, because
	that's what uses it.

2020-07-20  Andras Varga

	* Process ordinary events via cMessage::execute(), and let cMessage::execute()
	delegate everything to a newly created cSimpleModule::doMessageEvent() method.
	Also: cMessage::execute() made protected, to make it accessible from
	subclasses.

2020-06-23  Andras Varga

	* send()/sendDirect: introduced SendOptions and tx updates; cChannel
	API and cDatarateChannel changes

	Note: substantial changes in this patch are concentrated in cSimpleModule
	and cDatarateChannel, with necessary extra fields added to cPacket. The
	rest are to follow signature changes in cEnvir and cChannel API methods,
	and to record the extra fields in eventlog files.

	Updating a transmission (aka tx updates):

	Initial send() is interpreted as: "packet transmission begins now, packet
	content and duration are, as things are now, going to be this".

	Following that, an "update" (or any number of updates) can be sent. It is
	a packet with the updated ("actual") content, and with a
	"remaining transmission duration" attached. Updates may only be sent
	while transmission is still ongoing (t < txEndTime; note it is strictly
	less, not less-or-equal!)

	As an example, aborting a transmission is done by sending a packet with a
	truncated content and a remaining duration of zero.

	The transmission it modifies (in case there are parallel transmissions on
	the channel) is identified by the packet ID of the original transmission.
	Channels should understand updates and handle them accordingly. (Change
	to cDatarateChannel is part of this patch.)

	Receivers that receive the packet at the end of the reception (default)
	will only receive the final update, the original packet and intermediate
	updates are absorbed by the simulation kernel.

	Receivers that receive the packet at the start of the reception (see
	cGate::setDeliverImmediately(), ex setDeliverOnReceptionStart()) should
	be prepared to receive all of the original packet and the updates, and
	handle them appropriately. Tx updates can be recognized from
	cPacket::isUpdate() returning true. cPacket::getRemainingDuration()
	returns the remaining transmission duration, and cPacket::getDuration()
	the total transmission duration.

	As a safeguard against unprepared modules accidentally processing tx
	updates as normal full-blown packets, the module is only given tx updates
	if it explicitly declares that it is able to handle them properly. The
	latter is done by the module calling setTxUpdateSupport(true) e.g. in
	initialize().

	Non-transmission channels don't handle updates any different from other
	messages and packets.

	SendOptions was introduced as a means to handle combinatorial explosion
	of send() variants.

	More changes:
	- send() and sendDirect() now accept a SendOptions; sendDelayed() and
	  the sendDirect() variant with delay and duration now convert their
	  extra args to a SendOptions, and delegate to the "standard"
	  send()/sendDirect() versions.

	- cDatarateChannel: allow overriding the duration computed from the
	  channel datarate from the send() call.

	- cDatarateChannel: non-packet messages pass through without
	  interfering with packets.

	- cDatarateChannel: disabled channels to let transmission updates
	 through, so that it is possible for the transmitter module to abort the
	 ongoing packet transmission.

	- Note: tx updates (without duration/remainingDuration) are allowed
	  on paths without transmission channels.

	- signature change in methods that participate in the send()/sendDirect()
	 protocol: SendOptions was added to the arg list. This affects:
	 cGate::deliver(), cModule::arrived(), cChannel::processMessage()

	- in cChannel::processMessage(), result_t was renamed cChannel::Result,
	  and it is now a proper return value (not an output parameter);

	- remainingDuration was added to cChannel::Result.

	- cDatarateChannel's datarate is now optional: set it to 0 or nan
	  to leave it unspecified.  This change was necessary to support
	  transmitting frames with per-frame data rate selection.

	- Removed forceTransmissionFinishTime() from cChannel (and esp.
	  cDatarateChannel). It was a hack. Now you can use SendOptions::updateTx()
	  instead.

	- Rename: setDeliverOnReceptionStart() -> setDeliverImmediately()

	- Added cSimpleModule::supportsTxUpdates() flag

	- cPacket now carries a remainingDuration field

	- cPacket: eliminated FL_ISRECEPTIONSTART; isReceptionStart() now uses
	  remainingDuration as input; added a similar isReceptionEnd() method.

	- cPacket::str() overhaul to reflect new fields and uses

	- in the APIs, sendDelay and propagationDelay (which were sort of
	  combined into a single value) are now distinct, and handled
	  separately.

	- eventlog format changes: BeginSendEntry: added sendDelay and
	  origPacketId; SendHopEntry, SendDirectEntry: added remainingDuration

	- cSimpleModule: factored out a throwNotOwnerOfMessage() method to
	  eliminate a large chunk of nearly identical code in send() and
	  sendDirect().

	- cEnvir callbacks also changed: beginSend() takes SendOptions;
	  messageSendHop() and messageSendDirect() take cChannel::Result
	  instead of separate args.

	Note: cChannel::Result became a toplevel class (ChannelResult) due to the
	need to break circular dependency: "cenvir.h" cannot include
	"cchannel.h" (circularity) and C++ does not allow inner classes to be
	forward-declared (why??).

2020-07-16  Andras Varga

	* Fix assertion failure in deleteNetwork() after error during channel
	creation.

	Setting up a connection is a two-step process: 1. cChannelType::create()
	is used to create a channel object 2. channel object is inserted into the
	netwotk with cGate::connectTo()

	If step 2 is left out, e.g. because there's an error in step 1, a stray
	channel object remains inserted in cSimulation. During cleanup,
	deleteNetwork() panics (ASSERT) that the network could not be fully
	cleaned up.

	To reproduce: create a channel type, and set e.g. "delay=3kg+1m" as
	parameter

	Fix: deleteNetwork() to remove stray channel objects.

2020-07-16  Andras Varga

	* cStatisticBuilder: add possibility to disable auto-adding the warmup
	filter.

	This opens the possiblity for the user to add them in the way
	appropriate. E.g. cf.  min(warmup(foo)) [this is the default] and
	warmup(min(foo)) [which might occasionally be what the user wants instead]

2020-07-17  Andras Varga

	* getModuleByPath() adjustment: never return nullptr, even for empty
	strings.

2020-07-14  Andras Varga

	* cComponent: store per-component cSimulation pointers instead of relying
	on getActiveSimulation().

2020-07-13  Andras Varga

	* cMessage, cEvent: make the output of str() less verbose:
	  - arrival time, from/to module etc aren't very useful if message is not
	    currently in the FES
	  - module IDs are also not very useful, and take up valuable horiz. space
	  - control info: in practice they tend to be unnamed, so skip printing the name

2020-06-22  Andras Varga

	* getModuleByPath() made stricter (do not tolerate if module doesn't
	exist); added findModuleByPath().

2020-04-28  Andras Varga

	* cModule: allow modules to be deleted (incl self-deletion) and
	created at will during initialization.
	Note: new modules are always *appended* to the end of the submodule list,
	which makes things easier.

2020-06-23  Andras Varga

	* cDatarateChannel: in finish(), clamp "channel busy" signal end time
	to simulation end time. Otherwise, statistics can look weird: a channel
	could be busy for longer time than the total simulation time.

2020-06-10  Andras Varga

	* cConfiguration: refined method docs, added getConfigValue()/
	getPerObjectConfigValue() overload that take cConfigOption*.

2020-06-10  Andras Varga

	* simkerneldefs.h: remove obsolete PI define, use M_PI instead
	[reported by Christoph Sommer].

2020-04-30  Attila Torok

	* Fix bitfield checking in cXXXParImpl::getExpression(). (Thanks, Clang 10.)

2020-03-28  Attila Torok

	* Fix ParameterRef::print - remove stray trailing ")".

	network Net
	{
	   parameters:
	       int a;
	       volatile int b = a; // this was erroneously printed as "a)"
	}

2020-01-21  Andras Varga

	* Transmissionchannel-specific code moved from cGate::deliver() to
	cDatarateChannel::process(). cGate::deliver() is now completely agnostic
	of channel kind.

	Behavior change: messageSentSignal and channelBusySignal: the duration is
	now set on the packet when these signals are emitted, which is probably a
	good thing.

2019-11-19  Andras Varga

	* Support @class() property on object parameters: cObjectParImpl to check
	that contained object matches expectedType.

2019-11-20  Andras Varga

	* cObjectFactory::str() improved: add string "abstract class" if applies.

2019-11-20  Andras Varga

	* cParImpl: delete useless pack/unpack methods.

2019-11-14  Andras Varga

	* Disallow using object parameters in expressions.

	Reason: we have no idea of the pointer's status wrt memory management
	- Should we dup() the object? (e.g. if it came from a volatile param,
	  we definitely should)
	- If it's a plain cObject (no owner info), should we delete it when
	  no longer used? won't it lead to double deletion?

2019-10-28  Andras Varga

	* Support JSON-style parameters in NED: Added cValueArray and cValueMap
	classes; translate arrays and objects in expressions to cValueArray/cValueMap.

2019-10-24  Andras Varga

	* cPar: implemented OBJECT as parameter type.

2019-11-07  Andras Varga

	* Follow change: Implementation of opp_typename() moved to the common lib.
	Simkernel's opp_typename() now delegates there.

2019-11-05  Andras Varga

	* cConfiguration: Accept expressions as value for (most) config options.

	For options that accept values both with and without quotes (types STRING,
	FILENAME, FILENAMES, PATH), a heuristic decides whether a string is to be
	taken literally or to be evaluated as an expression. Namely, the value is
	regarded as an expression iff its first character is a quotation mark. If
	you have an expression that doesn't begin with a quotation mark, you can
	prepend it with '""+' ("empty string plus") to force evaluating it.

2019-11-05  Andras Varga

	* cConfiguration::parseFilenames(): Remove traces of obsolete
	@listfile/@@listfile syntax.

2019-11-04  Andras Varga

	* Follow change: some cClassDescriptor methods changed return type from bool
	to void, because now they report errors via exception instead of returning
	false.

2019-11-02  Andras Varga

	* Follow change: cDefaultList renamed to cDefaultOwner.

2019-11-02  Andras Varga

	* takeAllObjectsFrom() moved from cDefaultList to cObject.

2019-10-26  Andras Varga

	* Follow change: cClassDescriptor gained support for setting pointer members
	and array sizes: setFieldArraySize(), setFieldStructValuePointer(); added
	@resizable(false) in sim_std.msg where needed.

2019-10-31  Rudolf Hornig

	* Tidy the filename attribute of an xmldoc() NED function.

2019-10-23  Andras Varga

	* cNedValue renamed to cValue.

2019-10-21  Andras Varga

	* Allow xmldoc() (and possibly other functions taking filename as input)
	interpret the file name as relative to the dir the expression comes from.

	See include/ommetpp/ChangeLog for context and explanation.

	Details:
	- cComponentType: added getSourceFileDirectory()
	- cExpression::Context: added baseDirectory
	- added NedFunctionExt, which takes cExpression::Context *context instead of Component *context
	- cNedFunction to accept NedFunctionExt as alternative to NedFunction
	- cPar::parse(): added optional baseDirectory argument
	- Define_NED_Function() accepts NedFunctionExt too

2019-10-22  Andras Varga

	* cNamedObject: rename internal stringpool to more specific name.

2019-08-07  Andras Varga

	* cNedValue::intValueInUnit(): fix "Cannot convert integer from unit 'null'"
	errors.

2019-08-07  Andras Varga

	* cPatternMacher: Catch exceptions from underlying common::PatternMatcher,
	and re-throw them as cRuntimeError.

2019-08-29  Andras Varga

	* cDisplayString::getNumArgs(): changed return value to match the
	documentation (0 if there is no such tag, not -1).

2019-08-27  Andras Varga

	* cCanvas: cache min(animSpeed), so that Qtenv doesn't have to compute
	it every time. setAnimationSpeed() updates it on every call.

2019-08-27  Attila Torok

	* Work around double imprecision in cDefaultHistogramStrategy.

2019-08-25  Andras Varga

	* cXMLParImpl::forEachChild(): do not throw if value is nullptr.

2019-08-16  Andras Varga

	* cXmlParImpl::str() to return nullptr if applicable.

2019-08-15  Andras Varga

	* util.cc: Remove dead URLs from comment

2019-08-23  Andras Varga

	* cFigure: performance: Eliminate recursively updating figure tags when not
	strictly needed.

2019-08-23  Andras Varga

	* cFigure: fix bug that caused adding many (10000+) figures to the root
	figure very slow. addFigure() was needlessly updating tags on all figures,
	not just the newly added one

2019-08-25  Andras Varga

	* cMatchExpression: Catch exceptions from underlying common::MatchExpression,
	and re-throw them as cRuntimeError.

2019-08-01  Andras Varga

	* Follow change: Listeners to use intval_t and uintval_t instead of long and
	unsigned long; see include/omnetpp/ChangeLog for details.

2019-08-01  Andras Varga

	* Follow change: intpar_t renamed to intval_t.

2019-07-29  Andras Varga

	* cAbstractHistogram: added getBinEdges(), getBinValues().

2019-07-26  Andras Varga

	* Emit cPostModuleBuildNotification (new class) from cModule::buildInside().

	Reason: cPostModuleAddnotification was not sufficient, because it is
	fired from the cModuleType::create() method where the module was still
	very incomplete, and there are few meaningful ways to interact with it.

2019-07-26  Andras Varga

	* Emit cPostComponentInitializeNotification (new class) from module/channel
	initialization methods.

2019-07-26  Andras Varga

	* cChannelType::create(): Added missing envir->configure(channel) call.

2019-07-17  Andras Varga

	* cSingleFingerprintCalculator: Added options to hash display strings and figure
	geometry ('y' and 'f' ingredent letters).

2019-07-13  Andras Varga

	* cFigure: added hashGeometry() and hashGeometryRec().

2019-07-18  Andras Varga

	* cComponent::recordParameters(): call envir->recordComponentType(this)
	to save component type into the result file.

2018-07-09  Andras Varga

	* Allow recoding actual module/channel parameter values to the result file.

	cComponent::recordParametersAsScalars() was renamed to recordParameters(),
	and implementation was replaced to rely on envir->recordParameter() instead
	of recordScalar(). The old way, recording parameter values as ordinary
	scalars is still supported (use param-record-as-scalar config option).

2019-07-17  Andras Varga

	* Follow change: cContextSwitcher and co. moved to their own header file.

2019-07-17  Andras Varga

	* cContextSwitcher, cContextTypeSwitcher: micro-optimization: spare
	one call to getSimulation().

2019-07-16  Andras Varga

	* Optimized cModule::ChannelIterator, by maintaining a list of channels
	within the (compound) module.

	ChannelIterator is used e.g. in initialize() and refreshDisplay(). This
	change significantly speeds up Cmdenv's FakeGUI mode.

2019-07-15  Andras Varga

	* cfincMultiFingerprintCalculator: modernize: use C++11-style "for" loops.

2019-07-11  Andras Varga

	* Added cSimulation::callRefreshDisplay().

2019-07-08  Andras Varga

	* cDynamicExpression: added parseNedExpr(); added support for variables,
	members, methods and extra functions.

2019-07-09  Andras Varga

	* cNedValue: replace 'XML' type with 'OBJECT'

2019-07-10  Andras Varga

	* cNedValue: use safeMul() from common/.

2019-07-02  Attila Torok

	* Follow change: cEnvir::getConnectionLine() added.

2019-06-20  Andras Varga

	* cModule/cChannel: Initialization made more permissive. Already-initialized
	modules are just skipped, instead of causing an error.

	This is useful with network builder modules, as it allows initializing
	the newly-created modules (containing compound modules, channels, etc) by
	simply calling getSystemModule()->callInitialize() without causing an
	error due to the already-initialized existing modules.

2019-04-10  Attila Torok

	* cDefaultHistogramStrategy::collectWeighted(): Fix two asserts related to
	infinity counting.

2019-06-12  Rudolf Hornig

	* cXMLElement::addAttr(): Fix memory access error from PR#765.

2019-04-25  Andras Varga

	* cXMLElement: optimize for memory usage (some users have GiB files).

	Tag names, attribute names and values, src location strings, etc. are now
	stringpooled (unless longer than a certain limit).

2019-04-16  Andras Varga

	* Unit conversion functions were implemened as NED functions; now they are
	provided by common::Expression, so the NED functions could be removed.

2019-04-13  Andras Varga

	* Implemented 'bool' cast operator as NED function.

2019-04-11  Andras Varga

	* Ported statistics recording to the new Expression class.

	Expression filter, @statistic source= parsing and record= parsing has
	been reimplemented from scratch.

	Issues worth mentioning:
	- emit() uses long (may be 32 bit), ExprValue uses intpar_t (64-bit)
	  [solved in a later commit]
	- multipath propagation on input still causes glitches, so we still
	 raise error for them

	Everything should work exactly as before, module some changes:
	- ExpressionRecorder has not been implemented yet, so
	  ExpressionFilter + LastValueRecorder is used instead in its place
	- Old implementation used to add redundant IdentifyFilter sometimes,
	  this has now been eliminated
	- Notation changes in the debug-statistics-recording=true output
	  ($0, $1, etc instead of '<signalValue>', etc)

2019-03-11  Andras Varga

	* Ported NED to new Expression class. Affects cDynamicExpression, etc.

	Main changes:
	- Removed duality in parsing/processing NED expressions: expressions in
	  NED files and INI files were parsed/built in totally different ways.
	  We now use cDynamicExpression for both.

	- cDynamicExpression now relies for common::Expression for parsing and
	  evaluation. Its old parser (expr.y, expr.lex) has been removed.

	- nedsupport.h moved from include/omnetpp to src/* nodes must
	  now subclass from ExprNode, so they cannot be public.

	- in NED functions: context ("In function x():") was removed from error
	  messages because it will be added by the Expression class

	Everything is supposed to work exactly as before. (Modulo changes in
	error message wording.)

2019-04-04  Rudolf Hornig

	* Makefile improvements

2019-04-05  Andras Varga

	* cComponent: Improved error message on double-subscribe.

2019-04-05  Andras Varga

	* cResultFilter: added implementation of hasDelegate().

2019-04-05  Andras Varga

	* cComponent: disallow emitting nullptr as const char *.

	Reason: It cannot be represented by std::string, which causes problems  e.g.
	in statistical expressions.

2019-04-11  Andras Varga

	* Remove incomplete "constant subexpression" support from cDynamicExpression,
	cPar, cParImpl.	It was never implemented, but it was not really missed by
	anyone either.

2019-03-21  Andras Varga

	* cQueue: fix: Accept nullptr as CompareFunc.

2019-03-21  Andras Varga

	* cSimulation::loadNedSourceFolder() now accepts an optional exclusionPath
	argument.

2019-03-20  Andras Varga

	* cChannelType/cModuleType: error message cosmetics.

2019-03-20  Andras Varga

	* StatisticSourceParser: fix: @statistic signal checking used wrong isSimple(),
	should use cModuleType::isSimple() instead of cModule::isSimple().

2019-02-26  Andras Varga

	* NaryExpressionFilter: use prevFilter->getInitialDoubleValue() instead of
	NaN to initialize inputs. This prevents NaNs coming from filters expressions
	like count(foo)+count(bar) before all signals have emitted at least one value.

2019-02-22  Andras Varga

	* support for embedding NED files

2019-02-05  Andras Varga

	* Fix the documentation of the floor()/ceil() NED functions (they were
	swapped).

2019-01-29  Andras Varga

	* cModule: deleteModule() small refactoring: introduced doDeleteModule().

2018-06-11  Andras Varga

	* Revised module/channel deletion (destructors, deleteModule(), etc).

	Motivation: recent changes in C++ do not allow throwing exception from
	destructor.

	Changes:
	- cModule, cChannel destructor: added clarification that direct deletion
	 of module/channel objects is not allowed
	- use FL_DELETING flag to authorize destructor call from deleteModule()
	 and disconnect()
	- allow deleting submodule tree containing the currently active activity
	 module; use cDeleteModuleException for that
	- disallow deleting the system module, unless as part of network cleanup
	- disallow deleting modules before/during initialization (latter would
	 crash the multi-stage initialization code), unless as part of network
	 cleanup

2019-01-16  Rudolf Hornig

	* Makefile improvements.

2018-03-21  Andras Varga

	* cNedValue::intValueInUnit(): follow UnitConversion change, and
	no longer accept 0 without measurement unit.

2018-06-29  Andras Varga

	* Deleted the implementations of removed obsolete classes/methods,
	see include/omnetpp/ChangeLog for a list.

2020-01-06  ------ omnetpp-5.6 released ------

2019-12-03  Attila Torok

	* Implemented cLabelFigure::angle.

2020-01-03  Andras Varga

	* cAbstractHistogram: fixed getCDF() (bug #789)

2020-12-10  Andras Varga

	* cGate: implemented isGateHalf() and getOtherHalf()

2019-12-08  Andras Varga

	* cMessage: privateDup() changed not to affect nextMessageId.

	Otherwise message IDs may differ between Qtenv and Cmdenv, which may
	hinder debugging or produce differring fingerprints

2019-08-07  Andras Varga

	* cPatternMacher: fix: on error, throw cRuntimeError not opp_runtime_error,
	to let --debug-on-errors stop on invalid pattern syntax

2019-08-27  Andras Varga

	* cCanvas: cache the minimum of animSpeed values, so that Qtenv doesn't
	have to compute it every time.

2019-08-27  Attila Torok

	* cDefaultHistogramStrategy: Work around double imprecision.

2019-08-25  Andras Varga

	* cXMLParImpl: reduce chance of forEachChild() throwing.

2019-08-23  Andras Varga

	* cFigure: fix bug that caused adding many (10000+) figures to the
	root figure very slow. (addFigure() was needlessly updating tags on
	all figures, not just the newly added one.)

	* cFigure: eliminate recursion during refreshing tag bits where not needed

2018-06-11  Andras Varga

	* Revised module/channel deletion (destructors, deleteModule(), etc).

	Motivation: recent changes in C++ do not allow throwing exception from
	destructor.

	Changes:
	- cModule, cChannel destructor: added clarification that direct deletion
	  of module/channel objects is not allowed
	- use FL_DELETING flag to authorize destructor call from deleteModule()
	  and disconnect()
	- allow deleting submodule tree containing the currently active activity
	  module; use cDeleteModuleException for that
	- disallow deleting the system module, unless as part of network cleanup
	- disallow deleting modules before/during initialization (latter would
	  crash the multi-stage initialization code), unless as part of network
	  cleanup

2019-05-15  ------ omnetpp-5.5 released ------

2019-04-25  Andras Varga

	* cXMLElement: optimize for memory usage to allow loading large XML files.

2019-03-20  Andras Varga

	* Fix: @statistic signal checking used the wrong isSimple() method

2019-03-13  Andras Varga

	* Added new result recorders/filters: totalCount, errorNan, nanCount
	* Fixed RemoveRepeatsFilter (repeated NaNs were not filtered out)

2019-02-27  Andras Varga

	* Added user-accessible descriptions for result filter/recorder types.
	New registration macros were introduced to allow specifying documentation:
	Register_ResultFilter2(), Register_ResultRecorder2()

	* Fix: prevent initial NaNs coming from filters expressions like
	count(foo)+count(bar)

2019-03-12  Andras Varga

	* cQueue: added possibility to use comparator object (not just function)

2019-02-12  Andras Varga

	* Added TimeFilter, a result filter that replaces the value with its
	timestamp.

	* Added preciseDiv(int64_t, SimTime)

	* Added intuniformexcl() as NED function, global function, as cComponent
	method, as object (cIntUniformExcl)

2019-01-29  Andras Varga

	* Fix: cDefaultList: do not leave dangling owner pointer in undisposed
	objects

2019-01-27  Andras Varga

	* cModule: added containsModule()

2019-01-27  Andras Varga

	* cSimpleModule: remove deprecated legacy constructor

2019-01-22  Attila Torok

	* Add infinity counting to cAbstractHistogram and subclasses.

	Collecting positive/negative infinity no longer breaks the histogram.
	Instead, infinities are counted as overflows/underflows, and the bins are
	set up as if the infinities were not there.

	This also changes the ad-hoc text file format used by saveToFile()/
	loadFromFile(), because the classes need to keep the number of finite and
	infinite overflows, finite extrema, etc. in addition to data kept so far.

2019-01-22  Andras Varga

	* Fix in cKSplit, cPSquare: added missing clear() implementation

2019-01-17  Attila Torok

	* Fix cAutoRangeHistogramStrategy::clear().

2019-01-17  Attila Torok

	* Replace an incorrect ASSERT with a more precise one in
	cAutoRangeHistogramStrategy. This fixes some fingerprint tests involving histograms.

2019-01-16  Attila Torok

	* Prevent a use-after-free crash in StatisticRecorderParser.
	This surfaced while running test/core/statistic_record_1.test

2018-06-28  Andras Varga

	* resultfilters.h and resultrecorders.h made public

2018-06-25  ------ omnetpp-5.4.1 released ------

2018-06-21  Attila Torok

	*  cHistogram: Fix invalid bin edges in cHistogram when the range is too small.
	In one specific case, when the histogram wanted to set up 70 uniform bins
	on a very small range, but really far away from 0 (something like
	1457683.667621 - 1457683.667623), we ran out of precision with the double
	type. Some adjacent bin edges had the exact same value, resulting in failed
	assertions, and infinite loops trying to consume infinite memory.

2018-06-15  Andras Varga

	* cSimulation: snapshot(): Check for write errors when using std::ofstream

2018-06-15  Andras Varga

	* cComponent: fix "cannot cast to double" error when recording "int"
	parameters as scalars

2018-06-15  Andras Varga

	* Check for write errors when using std::ofstream

2018-06-14  Rudolf Hornig

	* Fix build with clang/c2 compiler (__has_builtin-related issue)

2018-06-11  ------ omnetpp-5.4 released ------

2018-06-08  Attila Torok

	* cRuntimeError: refactoring related to cEnvir "attach to debugger" changes:
	breakIntoDebuggerIfRequested() replaced by notifyEnvir().

	* cSimpleModule, cSimulation: in DEBUG_TRAP_IF_REQUESTED, call
	getEnvir()->ensureDebugger() before DEBUG_TRAP, to allow Envir
	launch an external debugger before executing the trap.

2018-06-08  Andras Varga

	* SimTime: more precise computation for integer/SimTime division.
	We try to compute it using integer arithmetic as long as possible,
	and only fall back to floating-point (double) division when the
	result is not an integer.

2018-06-06  Andras Varga

	* cPacket: refined str() method

2018-06-05  Andras Varga

	* Use SimTime's new ustr() where appropriate: in cClassDescriptor for
	displaying simtime_t fields; in cEvent's and cMessage's str() for dt.

2018-06-07  Andras Varga

	* SimTime: implemented ustr()

2018-06-05  Andras Varga

	* Register each measurement unit as a NED function as well. They
	accept dimensionless numbers and quantities with a compatible unit
	as well. E.g. the expressions mW(2*100) and mW(0.2W) both result in 200mW.

2018-06-04  Andras Varga

	* cComponent::forEachChild: eliminate a source of pontential infinite recursion

2018-05-31  Andras Varga

	* cDynamicExpressio: recognize "nan" and "inf" as numeric constants

2018-05-24  Attila Torok

	* Fix build with GCC versions prior to 5.x.

	These versions didn't yet have __has_builtin, nor __builtin_*_overflow,
	so don't assume they did.

2018-05-28  Andras Varga

	* cDynamicExpression: no not allow operations w/ logarithmic units,
	to rule out issues that would have little practical benefit in solving.

2018-05-23  Andras Varga

	* Implemented the NED "exists" operator

2018-05-18  Andras Varga

	* Implemented "typename" in submodule "if" and other expressions

	Note: typename is not allowed in a submodule VECTOR's condition, because
	type is elementwise, and we want the condition to apply to the vector as
	a whole (we don't want to allow "holes" in the submodule vector)

2018-05-18  Andras Varga

	* cNedNetworkBuilder: fix: allow empty typename value to be used

2018-05-17  Andras Varga

	* cNedNetworkBuilder: use cDynamicExpression not cParImpl for
	build-time expression evaluation

2018-05-17  Andras Varga

	* cDynamicExpression: allow extra information to be passed for
	evaluation

2018-05-18  Andras Varga

	* Renamed namespace NedSupport to all-lowercase

2018-04-11  ------ omnetpp-5.3 released ------

2018-03-01  Attila Torok

	* Update cDefaultMessagePrinter to use the new API.

2018-03-07  Andras Varga

	* cCanvas: added getAnimationSpeed(); better documentation for
	setAnimationSpeed() and holdSimulationFor()

2018-03-07  Andras Varga

	* Fix: forEachChild(): do not go into listeners which are not owned.
	If a module was hooked as a listener on another module, it was also
	listed in the child list (among parameters, gates and local objects)
	which was kind of weird.

2018-03-07  Andras Varga

	* Fix: cPars were visited both from cModule's and
	cComponent's forEachChild()

2018-03-06  Andras Varga

	* Result recorders: Added "timeWeightedHistogram" recorder

2018-03-01  Andras Varga

	* cHistogram: Do not keep numOverflows/numUnderflows for weighted statistics,
	only sums of weights.

2018-02-11  Andras Varga

	* cCanvas: Proper error message if "type=" is missing from @figure.

2018-02-08  Andras Varga

	* cDefault/AutoHistogramStrategy: fix std::bad_alloc on collecting an
	extremely large value.

2018-02-03  Andras Varga

	* cDynamicExpression: fix: wrong display of errors with operator "%".
	("%" was misinterpreted by cRuntimeError as format argument.)

2018-02-02  Attila Torok

	* Fix potential stack overflow in cComponent::forEachChild().

2018-01-31  Andras Varga

	* Make statistic recorders "findable" from Qtenv

	- make cResultListener subclass from public cObject
	- cComponent: forEachChild() to recurse into listeners that are cObjects
	- StatisticsRecorder: forEachChild() to recurse into stored cStatistic
	- StatisticsRecorder: take ownership of cStatistic (it can, since it is now cObject)
	- cResultRecorder: override getName() and getFullPath()

2018-01-31  Andras Varga

	* cModule: fix: forEachChild() skipped cComponent base class

2018-01-31  Andras Varga

	* sim_std.msg: Refinements
	- KSplitRecorder, PSquareRecorder were missing
	- listenedSignals[], results[]: changed @group to "signals,statistics".

2018-01-15 .. 01.29  Andras Varga

	* Implemented new cHistogram, histogram strategy classes, and implemented
	histogram API changes. See include/omnetpp/ChangeLog.

2017-07-19  Andras Varga

	* Removed transient detection and result accuracy detection classes

2017-02-10  Andras Varga

	* cMessage: remove experimental "tags" API

2018-01-12  Andras Varga

	* NED functions int() and double() now preserve the unit

2018-01-09  Andras Varga

	* cNedFunction: added "intquantity" (integer with a measurement unit)
	to the list of type available in NED function signatures.

	* cDynamicExpression: The evaluation stack now stores integer values
	as intpar_t (practically int64_t), and operations on integers are now
	computed using integer arithmetic. Before, the stack represented all
	numbers using "double", and integers >= 2^52-1 in absolute value
	could only be represented using precision loss.

	If one operand is floating point and the other is integer, the integer
	one is promoted to double.

	The guideline is that implicit precision loss should be avoided.
	Therefore, casting a double to integer now requires the use of the
	int() operator (thus making the loss of the fractional part explicit.)
	Integers are implictly cast to double; however, if the double cannot
	represent the given integer value precisely, an error will be raised.
	The double() operator can be used suppress that error and allow the
	computation to proceed with precision loss.

2017-12-14  Andras Varga

	* cNedValue: added INT type

2018-01-04  Andras Varga

	* cPar/cParImpl INT-releated refinements

2017-12-18  Attila Torok

	* gettime.cc: Added opp_get_monotonic_clock_nsecs().

2017-01-16  Andras Varga

	* cRealTimeScheduler: use opp_get_monotonic_clock_usecs() and int64_t
	instead of gettimeofday() and timeval.

2017-12-05  Andras Varga

	* Renamed cNEDValue, cNEDFunction, NEDFunction, cNEDMathFunction
	to cNedValue, cNedFunction, NedFunction, cNedMathFunction (NED->Ned).
	Old names can still be used via compatibility typedefs.

	* sim_std.msg: Adapted to message compiler changes, see src/nedxml/ChangeLog.

2017-09-11  Zoltan Bojthe

	* cPacket: Check that the length of the packet to be encapsulated is
	nonnegative.

2016-11-18  Zoltan Bojthe

	* cObject: dropAndDelete(): include actual owner in error message

2017-12-14  Andras Varga

	* cPar, cNEDValue, cExpression, cDynamicExpression, cParImpl, cLongParImpl:
	Follow changes in the header files (mainly the long->intpar_t change and
	its logical consequences, see include/omnetpp/ChangeLog.)

2017-12-09  Andras Varga

	* Reslt recorders: Added the "psquare" and "ksplit" recorders. They are
	useful for recording histogram information from a variable whose distribution
	is not known in advance, and might change over time. Internally they rely
	on the cPSquare and cKSplit classes, respectively.

2017-12-08  ------ omnetpp-5.2.1 released ------

2017-10-18  Attila Torok

	* Fix: Include windows.h with the correctly capitalized name.
	On Windows it doesn't matter, but when cross-compiling on Linux, the
	build failed.

2017-11-10  Andras Varga

	* cDynamicExpression: fixed leak in Elem::operator=() functions

2017-09-18  ------ omnetpp-5.2 released ------

2017-08-18  Rudolf Hornig

	* Elimnated some warnings

2017-08-14  Andras Varga

	* packetBytes/packetBits filters: throw error if object is not a cPacket.
	(nullptrs are allowed and ignored.)

2017-08-14  Andras Varga

	* Reasult filters/recorders: ignore NaNs. This change affects count
	(which now also ignores nullptrs), sum, min, max, avg, timeavg,
	sumPerDuration, stats, histogram. For the time weighted case, NaNs mark
	intervals to be ignored.

2017-08-08  Andras Varga

	* cResultFilter: added an init() method. That made it possible to update
	MeanFilter to obey the timeWeighted=1 @statistic setting.

2017-07-19  Andras Varga

	* Added "skipNan" result filter, for use with @statistic.

2017-07-17  Andras Varga

	* Statistics recording: added support collecting for time-weighted
	statistics of variables like queue length. Add timeWeighted=1 or
	timeWeighted=true to @statistic to make it collect time-weighted
	statistics.

	timeWeighted=1 affects the operation of the following recorders:
	"mean", "stats" and "histogram". The "timeavg" recorder always
	computes time average; an additional recorder "avg" has also been
	added that always computes unweighted mean. "mean" emulates either
	"avg" or "timeavg", depending on the presence of timeWeighted=1.

2017-07-15  Andras Varga

	* Histogram classes: added support for weighted statistics. See
	include/omnetpp/ChangeLog for details.

2017-07-12  Andras Varga

	* cStddev: implemented support for weighted statistics. See
	include/omnetpp/ChangeLog for details.

	Note: there is a slight change in the file format statistics are saved
	into (saveToFile() / loadFromFile() methods). Existing files must be
	re-recorded or hand-modified.

2017-04-06  Andras Varga

	* Modernizing: use C++11's range-based for loops where applicable, using
	clang-tidy's modernize-loop-convert.

	* Modernizing: replace INT64_PRINTF_FORMAT and LL with C++11's PRId64.
	Note: PRId64 includes the "d" that was not part of INT64_PRINTF_FORMAT
	alias LL.

2017-05-25  Rudolf Hornig

	* Updated makefiles for speeding up the build:
	- generated files are created only once, even when using parallel build
	- binaries are copied to their final destination using proper makefile
	  targets

2017-06-08  Attila Torok

	* Changes necessary for allowing the OSG Viewer to be factored out from
	Qtenv into as separate support library, loaded on demand at runtime.
	The sim. kernel	now does not link with, or otherwise require, the OSG
	libraries.

	Details:
	- cOsgCanvas now treats osg::Node* as opaque pointers. No attempt is made
	  to dereference it.
	- cOsgCanvas now performs osg::Node reference counting via cEnvir's new
	  refOsgNode()/unrefOsgNode() methods instead of Node's methods.
	- Removed sim_osg.msg, and OSG-related code from sim_std.msg. Contents has
	  been moved inside the Qtenv OSG plugin.
	- No WITH_OSG or WITH_OSGEARTH conditionals anywhere in omnetpp or qtenv.
	  The only difference with WITH_OSG is whether or not the support library
	  gets built. Consequences: the cOsgCanvas is always available;
	  cModule::getOsgCanvas() never throws "OSG not available" exception.

2017-06-12  Attila Torok

	* cRandom: fixed typo in ctor implementation. Use member instead of parameter.

2017-05-19  Attila Torok

	* Fixed assertion failure in static registerSignal() in a dynamically
	loaded lib.

2017-05-18  Attila Torok

	* Figure classes: fixed parsing of offset property for path figures.

2017-05-10  Attila Torok

	* Figure classes: implemented getEffectiveZIndex()

2017-05-10  Attila Torok

	* Figure classes: Implemented cPanelFigure

2017-05-04  Attila Torok

	* Figure classes: improvement in @figure parsing: allow empty string as
	property key if it has no values. Such property keys are created when
	there is a semicolon at the end of the list	(but within the parentheses).

2017-04-18  Attila Torok

	* Figure class: misc small refinements:
	- figure copying: zIndex was not copied
	- change notification adjustments

2017-05-08  ------ omnetpp-5.1.1 released ------

2017-03-31  ------ omnetpp-5.1 released ------

2017-03-27  Attila Torok

	* fix cClassDescriptor::double2string stack corruption fixed with long
	numbers.

2017-03-22  Andras Varga

	* fix cStatistic::freadvarsf()

	samples/histograms caused error when reading saved hist.dat, because
	cPSquare::loadFromFile() read too much when reading the n[] and q[]
	arrays from file

2017-03-14  Attila Torok

	* cOutVector: Removed remains of support for recording a pair of
	doubles in an output vector.

2017-03-07  Andras Varga

	* SimTime: code of ttoa() moved into the common library as opp_ttoa(),
	for reusability. (SimTime::ttoa() now delegates to opp_ttoa()).

	* SimTime: str() made more efficient (bypass std::stringstream and op<<)

2017-03-16  Rudolf Hornig

	* onstartup.cc: Detection of release vs. debug mode collision is now safer
	on Windows 7: __is_release_oppsim__ changed to __release_oppsim_magic_number__

2017-03-08  Andras Varga

	* statisticparsing.cc: Fix in @statistics processing:
	module in source=<modulepath>.<signal> attr did not take effect.
	Listener was mistakenly added to the module of the @statistic, not to the
	submodule.

2017-03-16  Rudolf Hornig

	* Minor changes in StartupChecker to improve the reliability of
	'release mode detection' on Windows 7 machines where GetProcAddress() was
	behaving unpredictably with certain big models (i.e. INET)

2017-02-06  ------ omnetpp-5.1pre3 released ------

2017-02-01  Andras Varga

	* Fix #823: added setBuiltinAnimationsAllowed() to sim_std.msg

2017-02-01  Andras Varga

	* Follow change: return type of send() and snapshot() methods changed
	to 'void'

2017-02-01  Andras Varga

	* Register the WarmupPeriodFilter class to make it accessible from user code

2017-01-16  Andras Varga

	* Implemented opp_get_monotonic_clock_usecs()

2017-01-02  Andras Varga

	* Follow cFigure API change related to parse(),	getAllowedPropertyKeys()

2017-01-02  Andras Varga

	* Follow API change: Canvas: added insertBelow() / insertAbove(),
	removed insertChild()

2017-01-18  Rudolf Hornig

	* Fixed build error if WITH_PARSIM=no

2017-01-06  Attila Torok

	* Fix cChannel::forEachChild bug (wrong superclass).

2017-01-04  Attila Torok

	* Don't notify about cDisplayString change if it didn't change.
	Also corrected (negated) the value of a state variable. The meaning
	inverted when it was renamed, but the usage stayed the same.

2016-10-06  Zoltan Bojthe

	* cPacket: use getBitLength() instead of bitLength member

2016-12-23  ------ omnetpp-5.1pre2 released ------

2016-12-19  Andras Varga

	* errmsg.cc/h: added E_REALTIME

2016-12-16  Andras Varga

	* Suppressed shift/reduce warnings in .y files by specifying the
	expected number of conflicts (%expect)

2016-12-02  Attila Torok

	* sim_std.msg: added missing cFigure declarations for Ring and Icon.

2016-11-30  Rudolf Hornig

	* build: Makefile refactored. Added clang-c2 support and optimized
	the build process.

	* build: removed Makefile.vc, as Visual C++ builds are now handled
	by the standard Makefiles.

2016-11-18  Andras Varga

	* Follow cEnvir APIs change: StaticEnv: added appendToImagePath(),
	loadImage(), getSubmodulePosition() dummy implementations.

2016-11-14  Andras Varga

	* cCanvas: implementatim: added Register_Figure(), plus tests

	* cArcFigure: fix so that it can be instantiated from an empty NED property

2016-11-11  Andras Varga

	* cModule: getModuleByPath(): "<root>" to mean the toplevel module.
	There was no syntax for that, apart from spelling out the toplevel
	module's name.

2016-10-30  Andras Varga

	* cException: put where/when information AFTER the exception text +
	nits. Goal: improve readability, as user needs to go through less blabla
	before getting to the actual error message.

2016-11-10  Andras Varga

	* Refined error messages: capitalization, quotation marks, etc.

2016-11-08  Andras Varga

	* sim/netbuilder: fix wrong matching order of patterns when processing
	deep parameter assignments (see NED_parampattern_5.test)

2016-11-05  Andras Varga

	* cXMLElement: getElementByPath() made more tolerant to whitespace
	inside the path string (see cXMLElement_getElementByPath_1.test)

2016-11-05  Andras Varga

	* cDisplayString: fix obscure parse error (see NED_display_n5.test)

2016-10-28  Andras Varga

	* Refined error messages.

2016-10-11  Attila Torok

	* sim_std.msg: Made displayString fields directly editable.

2016-10-27  Andras Varga

	* cAbstractTextFigure::getBounds(), cImageFigure::getDefaultSize()
	now return more precise dimensions, due to cEnvir change: its
	getTextExtent() and getImageSize() methods now return the size in
	doubles and not in ints.

	Motivation:
	- small font size (displayed zoomed)
	- SVG and other vector images that don't necessarily have integer
	dimensions

2016-10-25  Andras Varga

	* cConfiguration: fix: allow filename-type config values to be quoted.
	Necessary because result file names now routinely contain '#'.

	Examples:
	output-scalar-file=General-#0.sca   <-- wrong, as #0.sca is taken as
	comment output-scalar-file="General-#0.sca"   <-- OK

2016-10-22  Andras Varga

	* cConfigOption: Implemented new lookup methods find() and get()

2016-10-19  Andras Varga

	* Follow cEnvir API changes related to askyesno(), putsmsg(), alert(), etc.

2016-08-08  Andras Varga

	* cCanvas: implemented setAnimationSpeed(), holdSimulationFor()

	* StaticEnv: follow related cEnvir API change (getAnimationTime(),
	getAnimationSpeed(), getRemainingAnimationHoldTime())

2016-09-21  Andras Varga

	* Figure classes: setters methods to only fire change notification
	if value has actually changed.

2016-09-21  Andras Varga

	* SimTime: fix: ttoa() did not work for t=INT64_MIN

2016-09-01  Andras Varga

	* Canvas: added getPosition() to arc, rectangle, oval, ring, and
	pieslice figures.

2016-09-05  Rudolf Hornig

	* cOsgCanvas: understand WITH_OSGEARTH.

2016-08-31  Andras Varga

	* Canvas: added support for self-refreshing figures (cFigure::
	refreshDisplay()).

2016-08-30  Andras Varga

	* Canvas: parse() methods not to overwrite settings that are not
	 specified in @figure. This will allow settings set e.g. in the
	 constructor to take effect

2016-08-29  Benjamin Seregi

	* Fingerprint: fix: getAsString() returned a dangling pointer.

2016-08-26  Andras Varga

	* Canvas: follow API changes, see include/ChangeLog

2016-08-24  Andras Varga

	* cComponent: getDisplayString(): do not throw exception. The
	"Cannot access display string yet: parameters not yet set up"
	exception does not seem to be necessary or useful any more.

2016-08-23  Andras Varga

	* XML elements and XML parameters became made inspectable:
	  - cXMLParImpl::forEachChild() visits the contained cXMLElement
	  - cXMLElement::forEachChild() visits contained elements
	  - sim_std.msg: better descriptor for cXMLElement

2016-08-23  Andras Varga

	* cISimulationLifecycleListener's destructor to deregister the
	listener.

2016-08-23  Andras Varga

	* cComponentType: implemented getNedSource()

2016-08-23  Andras Varga

	* cPacket: getDisplayString() to fall back to the encapsulated
	packet's display string

2016-08-23  Andras Varga

	* cPar: fix: unit was missing from info string (str()). This was apparent
	in Qtenv/Tkenv inspectors, and made it difficult to edit the value.

2016-08-23  Andras Varga

	* cXMLElement: added str(), getXML()

2016-08-23  Andras Varga

	* cObject and subclasses: detailedInfo() removed. See include/ChangeLog
	for more info.

2016-08-23  Andras Varga

	* cObject and subclasses: rename info() to str(). See include/ChangeLog
	for more info.

2016-08-05  Andras Varga

	* cAbstractTextFigure: implemented "halo" attribute

2016-08-05  Andras Varga

	* cFigure: changed "childZ" parse-time attribute into "zIndex", a
	proper field in cFigure.

2016-08-22  Andras Varga

	* cDensityEstBase: saveToFile() fix; bug caused cPSquare to save an
	array of uninitialized values.

2016-08-22  Andras Varga

	* cStatistic and subclasses: loadFromFile() made safer:
	- use GNU's __attribute__(format(...)) for checking freadvarsf() args
	- opp_vsscanf(): more compliant to standard sscanf() (%lg to mean double)
	- %g -> %lg (follow opp_vsscanf change)

2016-08-22  Andras Varga

	* cDensityEstBase: bugfix in loadFromFile(): freadvarsf() read an int
	into a bool variable. Bug caused the Histograms sample to crash in the
	2nd and subsequent runs	(when user chose "Yes" to "Load previously
	saved data?" question) on 64-bit architectures.

2016-08-22  Andras Varga

	* cPSquare: use proper constant -DBL_MAX (instead of -1e50)

2016-08-22  Andras Varga

	* cPSquare: fix: ctor to deallocate precollectedValues[] which is unused
	by this class.

2016-08-10  Andras Varga

	* cFigure: implemented tooltip and assocatedObject

2016-08-02  Andras Varga

	* cPixmapFigure: added support for "fillColor" @figure attribute (initial
	fill for the pixmap)

2016-08-01  Andras Varga

	* cAbstractShapeFigure: fix: in @figure, lineColor=<nothing> didn't work
	as a means of setting outlined=false

2016-07-29  Andras Varga

	* cFigure: fix bounding box computation for anchor modes ANCHOR_E and
	ANCHOR_W. Affects several figure classes.

2016-08-01  Andras Varga

	* cProperty: implemented internal method updateWith()

2016-08-05  Andras Varga

	* cEvent: follow change: insertOrder needs to be eventnumber_t to prevent
	overflow

2016-08-05  Andras Varga

	* cEvent: implemented comparison functions shouldPrecede() and
	compareBySchedulingOrder()

2016-08-04  Andras Varga

	* cEventHeap: adjustment: insertOrder was not updated in the circbuf case
	(but was not used either)

2016-08-04  Andras Varga

	* cEventHeap: implemented setUseCb(false)

2016-08-04  Andras Varga

	* cEventHeap: fix: events scheduled for current simulation time w/
	negative priority were handled incorrectly

2016-08-03  Andras Varga

	* canvas: changed class name lookup for the @figure "type" attribute.
	Previous code did not play well with namespaces. Now, the type name
	is first tried "as is", second, by capitalizing it, and third, by also
	appending "Figure". That is, a figure class named inet::FooFigure can
	be referred to as "inet::foo", "inet::Foo" and "inet::FooFigure".

2016-08-01  Attila Torok

	* sim_std.msg: Figure fields grouped (added @group annotations).

2016-07-29  Attila Torok

	* sim_std.msg: ANCHOR_BASELINE_xxx constants were missing from the enum

2016-07-21  Andras Varga

	* cAbstractTextFigure,cAbstractImageFigure: implemented getBounds(),
	using cEnvir's new getImageSize() and getTextExtent() methods.

2016-07-28  Andras Varga

	* cFigure: fixed font parsing in inspectors (parseFont() method)

2016-07-28  Andras Varga

	* StatisticsRecorder: removed cObject as private base class. This fixes
	crash when inspecting the owner of HistogramRecorder's inner cStatitistic.

	Reason for the crash: when mapping the value returned by getOwner() to
	HistogramRecorder, the pointer value will be off (will point to the
	cObject part instead of the start of the object).

	This cannot be easily fixed, as multiple inheritance is not mapped well
	into cClassDescriptors.

	Workaround: StatisticsRecorder no longer owns the cStatitistic object
	(but calls removeFromOwnershipTree() on it instead) so it no longer needs
	to be a cObject.

2016-07-25  Andras Varga

	* cSimpleModule, cEnvir: messageSendHop(): added "discard" parameter;
	also: moved call site to include message's last hop. This is needed
	e.g. for Qtenv's message log view (we want to clone the msg while it
	still exists).

2016-07-25  Andras Varga

	* cResultListener: added getClassName() (note: str() was added earlier)

2016-07-25  Andras Varga

	* cStaticFlag: isSet() renamd to isMainRunning()

2016-07-22  Andras Varga

	* cComponent: internal change: SignalData renamed to SignalListenerList

2016-07-22  Andras Varga

	* cComponent: signal mayHaveListeners() / hasListeners() reimplemented.

	Use global data structure to store which signals have listeners at all,
	anywhere. This replaces per-module int64 masks.

	Rationale:
	- if a signal has listeners in one place in a module (i.e. in one host),
	  it is very likely to have listeners in most other places (i.e. all
	  hosts) as well
	- efficient for unlimited signals, not only for the first 64
	- straightforward implementation
	- possibly increased performance? as the "mask" argument has been reomved
	  from fire() method; less check at each ancestor, etc.
	- cComponent became 2*64bit = 16 bytes smaller

2016-07-20  Andras Varga

	* sim_std.msg: allow inspecting result recorders by adding a result[]
	field to cComponent.

2016-07-19  Andras Varga

	* @statistic parser: accept $input as (preferred) synonym for $source

2016-07-19  Andras Varga

	* Added str() to cResultListener, and implemented it for result filters
	and recorders

2016-07-19  Andras Varga

	* Result recorders and filters: receiveSignal() and other methods made
	protected. They only need to be public in the base class.

2016-07-19  Andras Varga

	* sim_std.msg: allow inspecting listener lists by adding a
	listenedSignals[] field to cComponent.

2016-07-19  Andras Varga

	* sim_std.msg: "properties" array in cComponent is now accessible with
	fewer levels

2016-04-19  Andras Varga

	* Follow cEnvir change: remove messageSent_OBSOLETE(), a relic from
	OMNeT++ 3.x.

2016-07-13  Andras Varga

	* sim_std.msg: describe result filters/recorders

2016-07-13  Andras Varga

	* cResultRecorderDescriptor renamed to cResultRecorderType, and
	cResultFilterDescriptor renamed to cResultFilterType. Reason:
	Now that cResultFilter and cResultDescriptor will be in the sim_std.msg,
	the orignal names collide with the names of message-compiler generated
	descriptor classes.

2016-07-14  Andras Varga

	* cModule: buildInside() retval changed from int to void

2016-07-11  Andras Varga

	* Factored out a StatisticBuilder class from EnvirBase, and moved it
	into the sim.kernel. Details:
	- defer configuring statistics recording to the end of buildInside() --
	  this is needed for next item
	- @statistic source to accept signals qualified with module path
	- check source signals in @statistic (default: check if it's a simple
	  module or channel; force with checkSignals key in @signal)
	- code to use symbolic constants for property names

2016-07-06  Andras Varga

	* cComponentType: factored out getSignalDeclaration()

2016-07-13  Andras Varga

	* sim_std.msg: fix ancient bug in cTopology descriptor (LinIn/LinkOut
	mismatch)

2016-06-23  Rudolf Hornig

	* The makefile now uses compiler-generated dependency files.

2016-06-20  Andras Varga

	* SimTime: added format(), currently as internal function for time display
	in Qtenv/Tkenv

2016-04-13  ------ omnetpp-5.0 released ------

2016-04-13  Andras Varga

	* cScheduler and scheduler classes: info() now returns a short description
	that will be displayed in the GUI

2016-03-23  Zoltan Bojthe

	* Added markup to config option descriptions

2016-04-01  Rudolf Hornig

	* Fix bug #943, error in cDatarateChannel::forceTransmissionFinishTime().
	It caused error when vector recording was on (recorded values not in
	increasing timstamp order)

2016-04-01  Andras Varga

	* cOsgCanvas: implemented zNear/zFar related changes (see include/omnetpp/ChangeLog)

2016-03-10  Andras Varga

	* cFingerprint renamed to cFingerprintCalculator, config option also
	renamed to fingerprintcalculator-class.

2016-03-10  ------ omnetpp-5.0rc released ------

2016-02-22  Andras Varga

	* cSimulation: moved both updating the event number and simulation time
	into executeEvent(). They were updated inconsistently, plus executeEvent()
	is a better place for that than getNextEvent(), considering cScheduler's
	putBackEvent().

2016-02-15  Levente Meszaros

	* Follow changes in the logging API, see include/ChangeLog

2016-02-05  Andras Varga

	* cEnvir: getRNGMappingFor(component) renamed to preconfigure(component)

2016-01-22  Andras Varga

	* cFigure: implemented API refinements, see include/ChangeLog

	* @figure parsing refined:
	  - transform= now accepts "((a b) (c d) (t1 t2))" and
	    matrix(a,b,c,d,t1,t2) syntaxes
	  - in transform=, scale() now accepts center as well
	  - in transform=, skew() now expects coefficient instead of angle
	  - arc, rectangle, image, etc to support bounds=x,t,width,height
	    as an alternative to the pos=,size=,anchor= triplet

2015-12-07  ------ omnetpp-5.0b3 released ------

2015-11-19  Andras Varga

	* Implemented the new fingerprint mechanism. It adds the following
	new configuration options:
	- fingerprint-categories=<string> (default: "tpl")
	- fingerprint-events=<string> (default: "*")
	- fingerprint-modules=<string> (default: "*")
	- fingerprint-results=<string> (default: "*")

2015-11-23  Levente Meszaros

	* cEvent: initialize insertOrder (not strictly needed, but cleaner)

2015-11-20  Andras Varga

	* cSimpleModule::scheduleAt() return type changed from int to void.
	See include/ChangeLog for details.

2015-11-17  Andras Varga

	* Some cComponent/cModule methods made const. See include/ChangeLog
	for details.

2015-11-21  Andras Varga

	* SimTime improvements:
	- cPar operations now use the "long" conversion when appropriate
	  (before it always used "double" conversion)
	- Refactored powersOfTen[] and setScaleExp()

2015-11-16  Andras Varga

	* SimTime improvements. See See include/ChangeLog for details.

2015-10-19  Andras Varga

	* Added extra arg (cObject *details) to emit() and cIListener methods.
	See include/ChangeLog for details.

2015-11-12  Rudolf Hornig

	* Fixed warnings.

2015-11-09  Andras Varga

	* Implemented refreshDisplay(). See include/ChangeLog for details.

2015-10-16  Andras Varga

	* omnetpp namespace made permanent (cannot be turned off):
	- removed configure option and preprocessor symbol USE_NAMESPACE
	- removed related macros: NAMESPACE_BEGIN, NAMESPACE_END,
	  USING_NAMESPACE, OPP, OPP_STR, OPP_PREFIX etc.

2015-07-24  Andras Varga

	* Implemented cOsgCanvas. See include/ChangeLog for details.

2015-07-20  ------ omnetpp-5.0b2 released ------

2015-06-29  Andras Varga

	* cClassDescriptor: string2enum() made more tolerant

2015-06-24  Andras Varga

	* sim_std.msg: refactored @enum annotations

2015-06-19  Andras Varga

	* cDynamicExpression: Fix #830 related bug: parser would crash on
	encountering a "//" comment in an expression

2015-06-16  Andras Varga

	* Cleanup: prefer ++it to it++ (less copying)

2015-06-12  Andras Varga

	* Cleanup: implement/follow iterator API changes (increment/decrement
	operators, operator* and operator->, deprecation of operator();
	see include/omnetpp/ChangeLog for details)

2015-06-08  Andras Varga

	* Cleanup: More camelization and variable renaming

2015-06-11  Andras Varga

	* if(dynamic_cast) refactoring: change code like

	    if (dynamic_cast<cComponent *>(object) != nullptr) {
	        cComponent *component = (cComponent *)object;
	        ...
	    }

	To:

	    if (cComponent *component = dynamic_cast<cComponent *>(object)) {
	        ...
	    }

2015-06-16  Andras Varga

	* FES made replaceable (see details in include/omnetpp/ChangeLog)

2015-06-15  Andras Varga

	* Follow deprecation of cQueue: length() and empty()

2015-06-09  Andras Varga

	* Follow removal of deprecated methods and typedefs (see include/omnetpp/
	ChangeLog)

2015-06-09  Andras Varga

	* Remove deprecated cModule::getModuleByRelativePath()

2015-06-15  Andras Varga

	* cPSquare: remove old inactive code; cosmetics

2015-06-08  Andras Varga

	* Cleanup: code formatting

2015-05-22  Andras Varga

	* Modernizing: added the 'override' keyword (C++11) to overridden methods;
	it becomes blank when using with an older compiler.

2015-05-21  Rudolf Hornig

	* Modernizing: replaced NULLs by 'nullptr' (C++11); it is defined as 0
	when using an older compiler.

2015-05-12  Andras Varga

	* Cleanup: data members, arguments and local vars changed to camelCase

2015-05-12  Andras Varga

	* Follow cException method renaming and related changes (see include/
	omnetpp/ChangeLog)

2015-05-11  Andras Varga

	* Follow method renaming in statistic classes (see include/omnetpp/ChangeLog)

2015-05-11  Andras Varga

	* Follow data member renaming and camelization

2015-05-08  Andras Varga

	* Removed deprecated opp_error(), opp_terminate(), opp_warning() functions

2015-04-24  Andras Varga

	* Follow change: cStatistic now subclasses from cRandom, and random()
	methods renamed to draw() (a random() still exists but is deprecated and
	delegates to draw())

2015-04-20  Andras Varga

	* Cleanup: use C++ names of C headers (e.g. <cstdio> instead of <stdio.h>)

2015-04-15  Andras Varga

	* Implement and follow signature change of random variate generation
	functions like exponential(). int rng argument became cRNG *rng and moved
	to first place.

	* Removed genk_intrand(), genk_dblrand().

2015-04-14  Andras Varga

	* Cleanup: Eliminating the "simulation" macro: replaced occurrences
	by calls to the getSimulation() function.
	Goal: long-term, there should be enough getSimulation() methods around so
	that the global function can be thrown out. Ultimately, we'd like to get
	rid of the activeSimulation global var too.

2015-04-10  Andras Varga

	* Cleanup: Eliminating the "simulation" macro: added accessor methods.

	- cComponent::getSimulation()
	- cComponent::getSystemModule()
	- cScheduler::getSimulation()

	Note: simulation.getModuleByPath() calls in modules can simply be
	replaced by the module's getModuleByPath() method.

2015-04-14  Andras Varga

	* Cleanup: Eliminating the "ev" macro; its occurrences have been replaced
	by calls to a getEnvir() standalone function.

2015-04-09  Andras Varga

	* Added cComponent::hasGUI() to replace ev.isGUI() calls

2015-04-12  Andras Varga

	* Cleanup: copyright years updated

2015-04-11  Andras Varga

	* Cleanup: standardize and qualify header guards with the OMNETPP prefix

2015-04-08  Andras Varga

	* Modernizing:

	- Use a fixed include path (-Iinclude -Isrc) for all source folders
	  under src/, and qualify cross-folder #includes with the folder
	  name (e.g. change #include "stringutil.h" to #include "common/stringutil.h").
	  This increases readbility and reduces the chance of including a wrong
	  header.

	- In source files, sort #include statements by folder.

2015-04-01  Andras Varga

	* Follow change: parsimPack() became const

2015-04-04  Andras Varga

	* Namespace-related improvements:

	- cObjectFactory::get() and find() extended with namespace lookup

	- signals type checking and createOne() to fall back to the "omnetpp"
	  namespace

2015-03-12  Andras Varga

	* Default of "**.log-level" changed from DEBUG to TRACE

2015-03-12  Andras Varga

	* cPathFigure fix: closePath() broke the path (figure was not displayed
	any longer)

2015-03-04  ------ omnetpp-5.0b1 released ------

2014-12-12  Andras Varga

	* cResultRecorder: ensure that finish() can only be called once (fixes #799)

2014-09-17  Andras Varga

	* Canvas API implementation finished. See include/ ChangeLog for details.

2014-08-18  Zoltan Bojthe

	* cEnum: added resolve(): similar to lookup(), but throws error if
	string is not found

2014-08-01  Andras Varga

	* cEnum: added bulkInsert()

2014-04-16  Andras Varga

	* cSimulation, cComponent, cModule: implemented component IDs:
	cSimulation now stores cComponent* not cModule*, so that cChannels
	have IDs too.

2013-11-21 Andras Varga

	Follow code cleanup, see include/ ChangeLog for details.

2013-09-26  Andras Varga

	* Implementation of the new logging API, see include/ChangeLog.
	Existing ev<< and ev.printf() logging statements were converted to EV<<.

2013-09-17  Andras Varga

	* cpacket.cc split from cmessage.cc; removed WITHOUT_CPACKET (a
	compatibility macro to help code migration from OMNeT++ 3.x to 4.0)

2013-04-24  Andras Varga

	* cancelEvent(): extra assertion: "cannot cancel another module's self-message"

2013-04-03  Andras Varga

	cTopology refactoring (use std::vector, etc.)

2013-03-19  Andras Varga

	* cDatarateChannel: forceTransmissionFinishTime() now emits
	channelBusySignal

2013-02-05  Andras Varga

	* cSimulation: changed fingerprint computation, so that the result
	becomes insensitive to module IDs, and sensitive to module path,
	message kind/length, message class name, control info class name,
	etc.

	Old computation mode can be restored with by defining USE_OMNETPP4x_-
	FINGERPRINTS (both when compiling OMNeT++ and models).

2013-01-28  Andras Varga

	* Implemented cEvent; see related ChangeLog entry in include/. Changes
	affect cSimulation, cMessage, cMessageHeap, cScheduler and subclasses,
	the parsim classes, etc.

2013-01-28  Andras Varga

	* Implemented simulation lifecycle listeners; see the ChangeLog in
	include/.

	* cSimulation: startRun()/endRun() removed, using lifecycle listeners
	instead

2012-11-05  Andras Varga

	* EXPERIMENTAL: In preparation for a remote simulation front-end GUI,
	added a mechanism for checking whether an object's state has changed
	since the last GUI refresh. For the bigger picture, see Cmdenv that
	contains the code that serves requests from the remote GUI.
	See include/ChangeLog for details.

	The code is currently surrounded with #ifdef SIMFRONTEND_SUPPORT,
	turned off by default.

2014-11-27  ------ omnetpp-4.6 released ------

2014-12-01  Andras Varga

	* Fix #769 cVarHistogram produces wrong results with custom (i.e. manually specified) cells
	* Fix #794 NED: pattern assignments of channel parameters doesn't work
	* Fix #793 NED: local parameters cannot be used to initialize an inherited parameter
	* Fix #782 CQN examples are not running

2014-10-07  Andras Varga

	* cStdDev: fix: getMean(), getMin(), getMax() now return NaN if count==0

2014-06-30  ------ omnetpp-4.5 released ------

2014-04-15  Andras Varga

	* Implementation of cMessagePrinter and Register_MessagePrinter()

2014-02-03  Andras Varga

	* Removed cCompoundModule. See include/ChangeLog for context.

2014-02-13  ------ omnetpp-4.4.1 released ------

2014-02-11  Andras Varga

	* signal checking: fix #714: class name resolution for @signal type attr
	should take @namespace into account

2014-02-13  ------ omnetpp-4.4.1 released ------

2013-12-20  ------ omnetpp-4.4 released ------

2014-01-07  Andras Varga

	* use EXECUTE_ON_SHUTDOWN() to invoke cGlobalRegistration objects'
	clear() methods, cNEDLoader::clear(), and cNEDLoader::clear() just
	before the program exits.

2013-12-20  Andras Varga

	* Just-in-Time debugging support: cRuntimeError to invoke cEnvir's
	attachToDebugger() if debugger-attach-on-error is enabled

2013-12-17  Rudolf Hornig

	* Removed a compatibility macro required for INET 2.0 to compile with
	OMNeT++ 4.3; INET 2.1 and later do not need it. (If you want to
	compile INET 2.0 with OMNeT++ 4.4, you need change getFieldArraySize()
	method calls in the source to getArraySize()).

2013-11-17  Andras Varga

	cResultRecorder: support $-variables in the @statistic title
	 - $name: name of the statistic
	 - $component: component fullpath
	 - $mode: recording mode
	 - $namePart[0-9]+: given part of statistic name, when split along
	   colons (:); numbering starts with 1
	The last one is useful with @statisticTemplate; e.g. if the
	statistic name is "tcpConn:host1>host4(3):bytesSent", and the
	title is "bytes sent in connection $namePart2", it will become
	"bytes sent in connection host1>host4(3)"

2013-10-03  Andras Varga

	* cResultRecorder: added support for programmatically setting up result
	filters and recorders on signals. This is made possible by adding new args
	to init(): cProperty* attrsProperty, opp_string_map *manualAttrs;
	this allows result recorders to be used without a corresponding @statistic
	attribute, e.g. they can be added to signals programmatically

	* cEnvir: added support for @statistic-style result recording on dynamically
	registered signals (e.g. "conn-<n>" where n is an integer). Instead of
	@statistic, use @statisticTemplate property in the NED file, and for each
	new signal call a new cEnvir method:
	   addResultRecorders(cComponent *component, simsignal_t signal,
	   const char *statisticName, cProperty *statisticTemplateProperty);

2013-11-22  Andras Varga

	* cSimpleModule, cSimulation: changes to support Tkenv's "Debug next event"
	feature. Both handleMessage() and activity() are supported.

2013-10-31  Rudolf Hornig

	* Fixed warnings when compiling with clang and -std=c++11 -Wall

2013-10-24  Andras Varga

	* Added optional checking of emitted signals against signal declarations
	in the NED file. Example signal declaration: @signal[numPackets](type="long")
	What it does:
	  - only signals declared with @signal may be emitted
	  - if @signal contains a "type=", data type is also checked.

	Check is turned off by default; it can be turned on with the
	   check-signals = true
	configuration option. It is planned that in the 5.0 version
	signal checking will be turned on by default. See related changes
	in include/ChangeLog.

2013-10-24  Andras Varga

	* Fix: implementation of cPatternMatcher::containsWildcards() was missing

2013-10-01  Andras Varga

	* Added result filter 'removeRepeats'

2013-09-26  Andras Varga

	* Fix: cPacketQueue's clear() didn't zero the bit length [reported by
	Guglielmo Morandin]

2013-09-12  ------ omnetpp-4.3.1 released ------

2013-07-29  Rudolf Hornig

	* Increased the maximum number of NED function parameters from 4 to 10.

2013-04-02  ------ omnetpp-4.3 released ------

2013-02-08  ------ omnetpp-4.3rc1 released ------

2013-01-29  Andras Varga

	* cModule: implemented the new getModuleByPath() method, and slightly
	updated the deprecated getModuleByRelativePath() and cSimulation's
	getModuleByPath().

2012-01-31  Andras Varga

	* Signals implementation now allows static initialization of simsignal_t
	variables. (See include/ChangeLog for more details)

2012-01-18  Zoltan Bojthe

	* Added calculateWeightedSingleShortestPathsTo() to cTopology

2012-01-18  Andras Varga

	* Added hasEncapsulatedPacket() to cPacket

2012-01-14  Andras Varga

	* Added the implementation of cPatternMatcher and cMatchExpression

2012-03-13  ------ omnetpp-4.2.2 released ------

2012-01-17  ------ omnetpp-4.2.1 released ------

2011-12-08  Andras Varga

	* nedfunctions.cc: implemented "any select(int index,...)"

2011-10-28  ------ omnetpp-4.2 released ------

2011-11-05  Zoltan Bojthe

	* Activities are now using the swapcontext() POSIX call to implement
	coroutines (if available on the platform). Newer Linux distros use
	'fortified' gcc, so the older coroutine library using
	setjmp()/longjmp() does not work any more.

2011-10-24  Andras Varga

	* ccomponent.h: asserted that registerSignal() cannot be invoked
	from static initialization code.

2011-09-11  ------ omnetpp-4.2rc1 released ------

2011-08-30  Andras Varga

	cmessageheap.cc: insert(): fix: must not use circbuf optimization if
	there's already a message in the heap scheduled earlier for the same
	simulation time, otherwise the insertion order of similar messages
	(same delivery time and priority) will not be kept.

2011-07-28  Andras Varga

	* csimplemodule.cc: fix: throwing "not owner of message" from send()/
	sendDirect()/scheduleAt() crashed if simulation.getContextModule()
	returned NULL (does not occur in event handling code).

2011-06-25  Andras Varga

	* The internal class cMathFunction was renamed to cNEDMathFunction,
	to follow similar renaming of corresponding registration macros
	(Define_Function --> Define_NED_Math_Function).

	* Result filter/recorder stuff moved here from src/envir, so that
	users can contribute their own result filters and recorders.
	See include/ChangeLog for more info.

2011-06-14  Andras Varga

	* cDynamicExpression::Value, also shared by cNEDFunction, has been
	factored out to a cNEDValue class.

2011-05-17  Andras Varga

	* cexception.cc: fix #301: cException::init() wrote 1 byte past the
	end of buffer[BUFLEN].

2011-05-05  ------ omnetpp-4.2b2 released ------

2011-04-15  Andras Varga

	* nedfunctions.cc: implemented the xml() NED function. It accepts a
	string argument, and parses it as XML.

2011-04-13  Andras Varga

	* nedfunctions.cc: added firstAvailable() NED function. It accepts
	a number of strings (varargs), interprets them as NED type names
	(either short names or fully qualified names), and returns the first
	one that exists and is also "available" (i.e. the C++ implementation
	class exists, see cComponentType::isAvailable())

2011-04-05  Andras Varga

	* NED functions (cNEDFunction class, Define_NED_Function() and
	Define_NED_Function2() macros): implemented varargs support.
	If the signature ends in ", ..." then the function will accept
	any number of additional arguments of any types. (At runtime, the
	implementation has access to both the actual number and types of args).
	When passing extra args, optional arguments (those marked with '?' in
	the signature) must all be specified, i.e. varargs can only come
	when all declared args are present.

2011-02-23  ------ omnetpp-4.2b1 released ------

2010-10-20  Andras Varga

	* cQueue fix: op= could result in a different order of objects than
	the original (if objects were not originally ordered according to
	the compareFunc)

2010-07-29  Andras Varga

	* fixed a number of parallel simulation related bugs:
	 - bug #193 issue 1: parallel simulation did not work with inout gates
	   (cGates were not replaced with cProxyGates on partition boundary)
	 - bug #193 issue 2: partitioning didn't work with scalar modules
	   (cause: for scalar modules, ev.isModuleLocal() was incorrectly
	   invoked with index==0 instead of -1)
	 - bug #193 issue 3: parallel simulation didn't work with scalar gates
	   on partition boundary (cause: scalar gates were not handled properly
	   by connectRemoteGates(): they were mashalled with index==0 which
	   peer interpreted as element[0] in gate vector)
	 - bug #194: Tkenv didn't animate messages send out of a parsim
	   partition, nor messages deleted by a channel (cause: missing cEnvir
	   call from cSimpleModule)

2010-06-11  ------ omnetpp-4.1 released ------

2010-06-09  Andras Varga

	* eliminated warning while compiling sim_std_m.cc

2010-05-31  ------ omnetpp-4.1rc2 released ------

2010-05-10  Rudolf Hornig

	* cDynamicExpression: assigning an integer parameter to a double
	parameter lost the unit during conversion, resulting in a 'cannot
	convert none to unit XXX' error message.

2010-05-09  Andras Varga

	* cPar: isNumeric() now returns false for boolean parameters. This is
	done for consistency, as calling doubleValue() and longValue() has
	already resulted in a "cannot cast non-numeric type" exception in the
	4.0 version.

2010-05-03  Andras Varga

	* std_sim.msg: "contents[]" is now displayed as "defaultList[]";
	group label "general" renamed to "fields"

	* cSimulation doesn't need to be cOwnedObject, cNamedObject is enough;
	this prevents "undisposed object cSimulation" message when simulation
	is killed via Ctrl+C.

	* disabled "Warning: cStaticFlag flag still set while shutting down"
	message, as it was always printed when exiting Tkenv via Ctrl+C.
	Can still be enabled when debugging an app that embeds simulation.

2010-04-30  Rudolf Hornig

	* added simTime() NED function to return the current simulation time
	  in NED expessions.

2010-04-27  Andras Varga

	* removed Enter_Method() from callInitialize() and scheduleStart(), as
	flashing "method call" arrows made it impossible to run in Tkenv
	models that generates lots of modules dynamically.

2010-04-23  Andras Varga

	* fix of bug #43: exponential(), normal(), truncnormal() and geometric()
	could  produce +INF, due to log(dblrand()) in their code where dblrand()
	can produce zero. Solution: use 1.0-dblrand() instead, i.e. (0,1] instead
	of [0,1). Side effect: fingerprint change for all simulations that use
	those distributions as input.

2010-04-20  ------ omnetpp-4.1b4 released ------

2010-03-29  Andras Varga

	* histogram classes (cHistogram, cLongHistogram, cDoubleHistogram):
	 - fix: setNumFirstVals() took no effect if no setRange..() method was
	   called
	 - save/load/pack/unpack used slots in firstvals[] only
	 - support for dup()
	 - in integer mode, use whole numbers as cell boundaries (not halfs);
	   the lower bound of a cell is inclusive, the upper limit is exclusive
	   just as with doubles
	 - default number of cells changed (30 in integer mode, 200 in dbl mode)
	 - in result files, an integer histogram is now denoted with the line
	   "attr type int" instead of "attr isDiscrete 1".

2010-03-14  ------ omnetpp-4.1b3 released ------

2010-03-11  Andras Varga

	* cComponent::recordParametersAsScalars(): recording a boolean parameter
	caused an error [reported by Alberto Cortes]

2010-03-10  Andras Varga

	* The transform() methods of histogram classes now throw an exception
	if the histogram was already transformed. Clients may call isTrans-
	formed() to determine whether transform() needs to or may be called.

2010-02-27  Andras Varga

	* created cHistogram class by merging cDoubleHistogram and cLongHistogram
	functionality.

2010-01-26  Andras Varga

	* fix: cProperties::getNames() and getIndicesFor() were broken

2010-01-23  Andras Varga

	* implemented signals mechanism. See include/ChangeLog for details

2010-01-22  Andras Varga

	* componenttype.cc: fix: crash if module object ctor throws exception

	* cdynamicexpression.cc: change: operands of the '%' (integer modulo)
	NED operator must be dimensionless (otherwise the result of truncation
	depends on the choice of the measurement units)

2009-12-17  Andras Varga

	* fixed bug #116: cPacketQueue::remove() incorrect behavior when called
	with a packet that was not in the queue

2009-10-14  Andras Varga

	* dynamic network builder: cComponentType::create() sets NED parameters
	as well from the similarly named submodule section of the parent
	compound module's NED file

2009-07-26  Andras Varga

	* bugfix: cpar.cc: parse() and some other cPar methods did not cause
	handleParameterChanged() to be invoked on the owner module [ViRe]

2009-07-26  Andras Varga

	* bugfix: opp_typename(): gcc demangling of pointer type names (Foo*)
	were not handled (they are needed for correct error messages in
	check_and_cast<>()).

2009-07-25  Andras Varga

	* cmessageheap.cc: FES performance improvement. cMessageHeap was
	changed to more efficiently handle the insertion and removal of events
	scheduled for the current simulation time. Such events are actually
	quite common due to plain (zero delay, zero datarate) connections
	between modules. The idea is to handle these events separately,
	without touching the normal FES data structure (binary heap).

	  Such messages (i.e. with arrivalTime==simTime() and priority==0)
	are added at the tail of a circular buffer, an O(1) operation.
	removeFirst() also checks the circular buffer first: if the buffer is
	not empty, it removes and returns the head element from it (also O(1));
	it only goes to the heap if the buffer is empty. This way the O(log n)
	heap insertion and removal operations are eliminated for these
	messages and are replaced with a small O(1) cost; the overall
	performance gain can be quite significant if the FES contains a lot
	of events (a few thousand or more). The extra overhead for non-matching
	messages is nominal. The circular buffer is reallocated when it gets
	full.

	  The observed performance gain was ~5% for a wireless INET model
	with an average FES length of ~500 events; a higher gain can be
	expected with larger models where FES handling dominates the runtime.
	For small models (FES size ~10) the performance gain is about 1%.

	* cmessageheap.cc: minor performance improvement: implemented operator>
	for cMessage instead of operator<=. This results in some performance
	gain for debug builds (not in optimized builds though where the compiler
	performs inlining and other optimizations).

2009-06-25  Andras Varga

	* ccomponenttype.cc, cdynamiccomponenttype.cc: made it possible to use
	a custom C++ class for compound modules as well (@class() property)

2009-06-22  Andras Varga

	* geometric(): assert that parameter p is in range [0,1)

2009-03-12  ------ omnetpp-4.0 released ------

2009-03-25  Andras Varga

	* bugfix: cArray::clear() crashed if there was a hole (NULL element)
	in the array; the bug got introduced in 4.0 [reported by Roland Bless]

2009-02-27  ------ omnetpp-4.0rc2 released ------

2009-02-24  Andras Varga

	* cStringPool: commented out dump() call in the destructor

2009-02-07  Andras Varga

	* cNEDFunction and Define_NED_Function(): changed signature string
	to a C-like syntax.

	* added description field to both cNEDFunctions and cMathFunctions

	* removed obsolete NED functions (genk_*: genk_uniform, genk_normal,
	genk_exponential, etc)

	* debug-on-errors: changes to the printed message

2009-02-04  Andras Varga

	* nedsupport.cc: fix: NED: a channel type could not refer to local
	parameters ("this.param" caused an error)

2009-01-10  Andras Varga

	* csimulation.cc: simulation.init() gets called automatically, via
	EXECUTE_ON_STARTUP()

	* csimulation.cc: calls to scheduler->startRun()/endRun() merged into
	cSimulation::startRun()/endRun()

	* csimulation.cc: scheduler object now gets deleted by cSimulation, not
	externally by Envir

2008-12-14  Andras Varga

	* sim_std.msg: fixed bug #33

2008-12-12  ------ omnetpp-4.0rc1 released ------

2008-11-26  Andras Varga

	* library renamed to oppsim

2008-02-25  Andras Varga

	* see include/ChangeLog for the summary of changes done for
	omnetpp-4.0, in the period 2006..2008.

2006-10-21  ------ omnetpp-3.3 released ------

2006-10-19  Andras Varga

	* csimplemodule.cc: bugfix: worked around Visual C++ bug that causes
	exception handling to mess up when SwitchToFiber() is called within
	a catch block. See Microsoft forum patch:
	http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=835791&SiteID=1&mode=1

2006-09-28  Andras Varga

	* cmessage.cc: fix in refcounting code: when decrementing refcount
	for encapsulated msg, its ownerp should be NULL'ed out if it
	originally pointed to this message. This bug caused Tkenv to crash
	when the encapsulated message's inspector was open (as it tried
	to print fullPath()).

2006-03-19  Andras Varga

	* csimul.cc: added implementation of guessNextEvent() etc. Removed
	updating simTime() from doOneEvent() which interfered with some
	parallel simulation algorithms (caused false "causality violation"
	errors).

2006-03-15  Andras Varga

	* distrib.cc: gamma_d() was bogus for the alpha<1 case [reported by
	Patrick McDonnell]. For alpha>1, use Marsaglia2000 instead of
	Cheng-Feast79.

2006-02-27  Andras Varga

	* cmersennetwister.cc, clcg32.cc: initialize() updated for parallel
	simulation

2006-01-12  ------ omnetpp-3.2p1 released ------

2005-10-19  ------ omnetpp-3.2 released ------

2005-10-05  Andras Varga

	* cgate.cc: performance: made fullname creation on-demand

2005-09-15  Andras Varga

	* csimplemodule.cc: added method cancelAndDelete(cMessage *msg).

2005-09-14  Andras Varga

	* cpolymorphic.cc, etc: dup() moved up to cPolymorphic, and return type
	changed to cPolymorphic. See include/ChangeLog.

	* cmodule.cc, csimplemodule.cc, etc: module constructor signature
	change, see comment in include/ChangeLog

2005-09-12  Andras Varga

	* cxmlelement.cc, minixpath.cc: fixed getElementByPath() bug
	introduced 2005-08-09.

	* cdefaultlist.cc: destructor to use ev.undisposedObject().

2005-08-09  Andras Varga

	* cxmlelement.cc: bugfixes in the mini-XPath interpreter (leading
	'//' was handled incorrectly), and stripped minixpath.cc/h from it.

2005-08-07  Andras Varga

	* cxmlelement.cc: the builtin mini-XPath interpreter turned into a
	class (MiniXPath), and it now understands parameters ($PARAM) inside
	predicates; parameter values come from a cXMLElement::ParamResolver
	object.

	* cmessage.cc: implemented reference counting of encapsulated messages.
	See include/ChangeLog for more comments.

2005-07-25  Andras Varga

	* coutvect.cc: implemented recordWithTimestamp() functions.

	* cpar.cc: added call to omodp->handleParameterChange() to cModulePar
	each time the parameter's value changes.

	* cpar.cc: removed beforeChange()/afterChange() calls from setInput()
	and setPrompt(), because these methods don't change the stored value.

	* several files: adopted to cCommBuffer change (packObject(),
	unpackObject() moved into the class)

	* cstat.cc: cStdDev::info() now prints mean, stddev, min, max as well

2005-07-24  Andras Varga

	* cdispstr.cc: added setTagArg() method for numeric (long) argument.

	* cpar.cc: added isConstant() member to cPar

	* cmessage.cc: arrivedOn() impl change, see include/ChangeLog

	* cxmlelement.cc: added getFirstChildWithTagName(const char *tagname)
	and getNextSiblingByTagName(const char *tagname) to cXMLElement

	* ctypes.cc: cModuleType::createScheduleInit(): NULL is not allowed
	as parent module

2005-07-23  Andras Varga

	* cwatch.cc: WATCH implementation changed

	* added cstlwatch.cc

2005-04-27  Andras Varga

	* cobject.cc: fixed bug in cObject copy ctor. Problem hasn't surfaced
	earlier because no subclass used this ctor (they use op=) [reported by
	Shanti]

2005-04-21  Andras Varga

	* util.cc: implemented simtimeToStrShort().

	* cmessage.cc: changed cMessage::info() to display time *until*
	arrivaltime as well

2005-04-05  Andras Varga

	* cstringtokenizer.cc: fix: prepared cStringTokenizer for receiving
	NULL as input/delimiter string. [reported by Tom Parker]

2005-03-31  ------ omnetpp-3.1 released ------

2005-03-22  Andras Varga

	* cpar.cc: updated for changed cEnvir::getParameter() return type, see
	include/ChangeLog and src/envir/ChangeLog.

2005-03-19  Andras Varga

	* cdispstr.cc: fixed incorrect handling of terminating stray backlash
	during parsing

2005-03-18  Andras Varga

	* added cstrtokenizer.cc

2005-03-17  Andras Varga

	* cscheduler.cc: implemented executionResumed() in cRealtimeScheduler

2005-03-15  Andras Varga

	* cexception.cc: implemented cRuntimeError.

	* several files: changed throw new cException to throw new
	cRuntimeError.

	* new omnetpp.ini entry:
	  [General]
	  debug-on-errors = true/false  (default: false)
	If turned on, errors will cause the program to break into the C++
	debugger. More previsely, cRuntimeError's constructor will do
	__asm int 3 (debugger interrupt) on Windows, and raise(SIGABRT)
	on other platforms (Linux, etc). This makes it possible to
	investigate the context (stack frames, variables etc) of a runtime
	error.

	* cmessage.cc: setControlInfo(), removeControlInfo(), destructor:
	control info isn't supposed to be a cObject, but if it is, call
	take() and drop() on it. [reported by Kurtis Kredo II]

2005-03-07  Andras Varga

	* chist.cc: changed to eliminate warnings about converting double to
	int

2005-02-06  Andras Varga

	* csimplemodule.cc: send()/sendDelayed() fix: check if output gate is
	connected. If we didn't throw error there, msg would be delivered back
	to the sender module as a self-message.

2005-01-12  Andras Varga

	csimplemodule.cc, csimul.cc: changed the way scheduled events or sent
	messages for deleted or finished (see cSimpleModule::end()) modules
	are handled. Before, these messages were deleted by the cSimpleModule
	destructor, but this made it very long to clean up large models.
	Now, messages are not deleted in the dtor, but left in the FES -- they
	will be discarded in cSimulation::selectNextModule() when they're met.

2005-01-10  Andras Varga

	* cscheduler.cc: added cRealTimeScheduler implementation

2005-01-07  Andras Varga

	* cdispstr.cc: getTagArg(): fixed to never return NULL (returns ""
	instead)

2005-01-02  Andras Varga

	* cstruct.cc: fix: cStructDescriptor ctor crashed if NULL pointer was
	passed to it

2004-12-29  ------ omnetpp-3.0 released ------

2004-12-27  Andras Varga

	* csimplemodule.cc: fix: in Windows, creation of activity() simple
	modules crashed if coroutine (win32 Fiber) could not be created.

2004-12-22  Andras Varga

	* chist.cc: cLongHistogram changes to enable num_cells set up
	adaptively. See class doc for more info.

2004-12-22  Andras Varga

	* csimplemodule.cc: "scheduleAt(): not owner of message" error message
	(and similar messages from send() and sendDirect()) changed to
	something hopefully more intuitive for users. One of the following
	messages will be displayed:
	- "scheduleAt(): message (class)msgname is currently scheduled,
	  use cancelEvent() before rescheduling";
	-  "scheduleAt(): cannot schedule message (class)msgname: it is
	  currently scheduled as self-message for ANOTHER module";
	- "scheduleAt(): cannot schedule message (class)msgname: it is
	  "currently in scheduled-events, being underway between two modules";
	- "scheduleAt(): cannot schedule message (class)msgname: it is
	  currently contained/owned by (...)...".

2004-12-19  Andras Varga

	* cstruct.cc: added baseclassname, baseclassdesc

2004-12-16  Andras Varga

	* cgate.cc, cmodule.cc: removed ev.getDisplayString() and support
	for display strings in omnetpp.ini (section [DisplayStrings])

	* optimizations

2004-12-10  Andras Varga

	* csimulation.cc: implemented getUniqueNumber()

2004-12-08  Andras Varga

	* cpar.cc: read(): invoke new ev.getParameterUseDefault() function

2004-11-27  Andras Varga

	* nearly all .cc files: forEach() methods ported to cVisitor, see
	include/ChangeLog

2004-11-23  Andras Varga

	* cchannel.cc: parameter "disabled" of cSimpleChannel made to work

	* cgate.cc: info() string improved

	* cmodule.cc: displayStringAsParent() renamed to backgroundDisplay-
	String()

	* cchannel.cc: cSimpleChannel renamed to cBasicChannel

2004-11-23  ------ omnetpp-3.0b1 released ------

2004-11-08  Andras Varga

	* cmodule.cc: fix: checkInternalConnections() reported error on zero-
	size gate vectors too

2004-11-03  ------ omnetpp-3.0a9 released ------

2004-10-27  Andras Varga

	* checked in MersenneTwister.h v1.0 (15 May 2003) from Richard J.Wagner
	rjwagner@writeme.com; code is under the BSD license.
	http://www-personal.engin.umich.edu/~wagnerr/MersenneTwister.html

	* added cRNG implementations clcg32.cc/h (wraps old OMNeT++ RNG),
	cmersennetwister.cc/h (wraps Mersenne Twister, MersenneTwister.h)

	* ctype.cc: added call to ev.getRNGMappingFor(mod) in cModuleType's
	create() method.

2004-10-25  Andras Varga

	* all files: info() and fullPath() signature change (see
	include/ChangeLog)

2004-10-10  Andras Varga

	* csimul.cc: fix: added preliminary setting of simtime to end of
	doOneEvent() -- this fixes bug in Tkenv "run until sim.time" function,
	and sim.time display when single-stepping (it used to display time of
	last event, should be time of next event)

2004-10-04  ------ omnetpp-3.0a8 released ------

2004-09-24  ------ omnetpp-3.0a7 released ------

2004-09-15  Andras Varga

	* ctopo.cc: implemented 2 new extractByModuleType() functions, see
	include/ChangeLog.

	* cmodule.cc: support for zero-sized module gates. A gate vector
	is zero size right after creation, and if there's no gatesize declared
	in NED (and there's no manual setGateSize() call) it'll remain zero
	size. A zero-sized gate vector is represented by a single gate object
	whose size() method returns zero, and cannot be connected.

2004-08-11   Andras Varga

	* cchannel.cc: added check for negative delays

2004-07-22  ------ omnetpp-3.0a6 released ------

2004-07-15   Andras Varga

	* csimul.cc: deleteNetwork(): moved flushing event queue after deleting
	modules (because module destructors may contain delete cancelEvent(msg)
	calls)

2004-07-10   Andras Varga

	* csimul.cc,cmodule.cc,util.cc: added cSimulation::contextType() stuff

2004-07-05   Andras Varga

	* csimplemodule.cc: recordScalar() functions for text and cStatistic
	data removed. A cStatistic object can be recorded into the scalar file
	by calling its recordScalar() method (below).

	* cstat.cc: added recordScalar() method.

2004-06-24  Andras Varga

	* cpar.cc: implemented support for type M (XML element) in cPar.

2004-06-22  Andras Varga

	* added cxmlelement.cc

2004-06-07  ------ omnetpp-3.0a5 released ------

2004-05-15  ------ omnetpp-3.0a4 released ------

2004-04-16  Andras Varga

	* cpar.cc, cenum.cc: fixed two possible bugs after Johnny's valgrinding

2004-04-13  Andras Varga

	* cmessage.cc: implemented new cMessage methods setControlInfo(),
	removeControlInfo(), controlInfo().

2004-04-04  Andras Varga

	* simplemodule.cc: cancelEvent(): don't throw error if message is not
	currently scheduled, just return.

2004-03-22  ------ omnetpp-3.0a3 released ------

2004-03-03  ------ omnetpp-3.0a2 released ------

2004-02-23  Andras Varga

2004-02-22  Andras Varga

	* cmodule.cc: added gateSize() to cModule.

2004-02-21  Andras Varga

	* cmodule.cc: setGateSize() made more tolerant; this is needed for
	"gate++" NED feature (see nedxml/ChangeLog)

	* cpar.cc: turned type character into English type names in cPar error
	messages, e.g. "Cannot cast from type `D' to `S'" became
	"Cannot cast from type double (D) to string (S)'".

2004-02-20  Andras Varga

	* ctype.cc, cchannel.cc, cgate.cc: introduced cChannelType which
	replaces cLinkType. See include/ChangeLog for more info.

2004-02-12  Andras Varga

	* cmodule.cc, cgate.cc, cchannel.cc: gave a bool return value to
	deliver(), "false" meaning that message object should be deleted.

2004-02-11  Andras Varga

	* csimul.cc, cscheduler.cc: semantic change of getNextEvent()'s and
	selectNextModule()'s return value (see include/ChangeLog)

2004-02-10  Andras Varga

	* cexception.cc: added storage of module class name (NED type name)

2004-02-09  Andras Varga

	* ctypes.cc: added methods to cModuleInterface so that it's possible
	to dynamically assemble it (needed by networkbuilder)

2004-02-07  Andras Varga

	* ctypes.cc: added createOneIfClassIsKnown(const char *classname)

	* cstruct.cc: fix createDescriptorFor() to prepare for missing
	descriptor object

2004-02-06  Andras Varga

	* cgate.cc: implemented cGate::disconnect(); revised cGate::connectTo()

	* cchannel.cc: added setDelay(double), setError(double),
	setDatarate(double) to cSimpleChannel

2004-02-04  ------ omnetpp-3.0pre1 released ------

2004-01-09  Andras Varga

	* cmodule.cc: implemented bubble()

2004-01-05  Andras Varga

	* HEAVY CHANGES throughout the code, see include/ChangeLog entry with
	same date.

	* cDisplayStringParser:
	- cDisplayStringParser renamed to cDisplayString
	- backslash parsing improved (now recognizes backslash sequences
	  \t, \n, \r, \f, \b, \x0A with same meaning as in C/C++)
	- notify() and assemble() only if needed (there is some change)

2003-11-30  Andras Varga

	* all files: info() no longer contains object name and class

2003-11-22  Andras Varga

	* carray.cc: fixed bug in cBag which caused crash under certain rare
	circumstances [reported by Nicolas Betbeder-Matibet]

2003-11-13  Andras Varga

	* distrib.cc: added typecast for MSVC 7.0 compiler [reported by Bob
	Scheffler]

2003-11-13  Andras Varga

	* Checked in parallel simulation code that was developed March-May 2003,
	during my stay at Monash University. Changes:

	2003-04-20  Andras Varga
	* cmodule.cc: setGateSize(): added check for negative vector size

	2003-03-30  Andras Varga
	* Makefile.vc uses implicit rules

	2003-03-25  Andras Varga
	* cmodule.cc: method isSimple() moved to base class cModule where it
	uses dynamic_cast.
	* ctypes.cc: cModuleType::create() methods reorganized (see
	include/ChangeLog)

	2003-03-23  Andras Varga
	* split cmodule.cc: cSimpleModule put into new file csimplemodule.cc
	* cobject.cc: type of namestr member changed from char* to opp_string
	* added cscheduler.cc, changed csimul.cc: cSimulation::nextModule()
	now relies on a scheduler object, subclassed from cScheduler.

	2003-03-20  Andras Varga
	* nearly all files: implementations of netPack()/netUnpack() moved
	here from MPI/PVM directories. These functions now use the cCommBuffer
	interface, so they're no longer specific to the communications library
	(ie.MPI.PVM,..)

2003-11-09  Andras Varga

	* csimul.cc: added optional support for dynamic loading of NED files.
	If WITH_NETBUILDER was defined (e.g. via -D compiler option) when
	compiling the sim. kernel, one can use the cSimulation::loadNedFile()
	function to pull in compound modules, channels and network definitions
	from NED files at runtime. If the sim. kernel was compiled without
	WITH_NETBUILDER, the cSimulation::loadNedFile() throws an exception
	when called.
	   cSimulation::loadNedFile() works by invoking code in src/netbuilder,
	which in turn relies on the nedxml library. Thus, when WITH_NETBUILDER
	is used, simulation executables must be linked with the nedxml library
	(and thus also with an XML parser, if nedxml was compiled to support
	XML input). When compiling without WITH_NETBUILDER, nedxml and also
	the stuff in src/netbuilder can be left out from the link.

2003-11-01  Andras Varga

	* cdispstr.cc: cDisplayString::setTagArg() now adds the tag if it
	doesn't exist yet

2003-10-21  Andras Varga

	* csimul.h: fixed simulation.moduleByPath(): it didn't work when
	name of system module (the toplevel module) was included in the path
	[reported by Andreas Koepke]

2003-10-02  Andras Varga

	* util.h: added implementation of cContextSwitcher internal class,
	needed by the new Enter_Method() and Enter_Method_Silent() macros.

	* ccoroutine.cc: bugfix: DeleteFiber(lpFiber) crashes if lpFiber==0
	on Win2003 Server (maybe elsewhere too). [reported by Donald Von]

2003-09-22  Andras Varga

	* cmodule.cc: sendDirect() rules slightly modified, see header file.

2003-06-16  ------ omnetpp-2.3 released ------

2003-06-16  Andras Varga

	* cexception.cc: handle exceptions during initialization:
	if cException ctor is invoked before main() has started, we print
	the error message and call exit(1).

2003-06-14  Andras Varga

	* cmodule.cc: cModule's addGate(), addPar() return type changed from
	void to cGate*/cPar*.

2003-04-15  Andras Varga

	* cmodule.cc: fixed bug introduced in 2.3b1 in deleteModule()
	which caused deleting another module (i.e. mod->deleteModule())
	to crash.

2003-03-15  ------ omnetpp-2.3b2 released ------

2003-03-15  Andras Varga

	* cchannel.cc, cgate.cc: refined channel attributes handling, isBusy(),
	transmissionFinishes().

2003-03-10  Andras Varga

	* ctype.cc: fixed bug (introduced in 2.3b1) in cLinkType constructor
	which eventually caused NED channels not to work.

2003-02-15  ------ omnetpp-2.3b1 released ------

2003-02-15  Andras Varga

	* chist.cc: fix: clearResult() now doesn't reset num_cells.

	* To be done in the future: observation count and histogram cell values
	should be made unsigned long, and when obs. count would overflow,
	issue a warning and ignore further collect() calls. Also TBD:
	check for integer overflows in cKSplit and cPSquare.

2003-02-14  Andras Varga

	* cpar.cc: getAsText(): better handling of long string values

2003-02-11  Andras Varga

	* distrib.cc: bugfix in beta()
	* cexception.h: added missing includes string.h and stdarg.h

2003-02-10  Andras Varga

	* chist.cc: cEqdHistogramBase: collectTransformed() and pdf() made
	safer (floating-point rounding errors could cause addressing out
	of cellv[] array)

2003-01-30  Andras Varga

	* added handling of new MathFunc4Args where needed

2003-01-23  Andras Varga

	* NOTE about Fibers, the Win32 API used to implement activity()
	on Windows. The number of fibers (that is, the number of modules
	using activity() in a network) is limited by the available memory
	and the available address space according to the following.
	Each fiber has its own stack, by default 1MB (this is the "reserved"
	stack space -- i.e. reserved in the address space, but not the full
	1MB is actually "committed", i.e. has physical memory assigned to it).
	This means that a 2GB address space will run out after 2048 fibers,
	which is way too few. (In practice, you won't even be able to create
	this many fibers, because physical memory is also a limiting factor).
	Therefore, the 1MB reserved stack size (RSS) must be set to a smaller
	value: the coroutine stack size requested for the module, plus
	extra-stack-for-envir, the sum of the two typically around 32K.
	Unfortunately, the CreateFiber() Win32 API doesn't allow the RSS to be
	specified. The more advanced CreateFiberEx() API which accepts RSS as
	parameter is only available from Windows XP!!!! The alternative is
	the stacksize parameter stored in the EXE header, which can be set
	via the STACKSIZE .def file parameter, via the /stack linker option,
	or on an existing execuable using the editbin /stack utility.
	This parameter specifies a common RSS for the main program stack,
	fiber and thread stacks. 64K should be enough. This is the way
	simulation executable should be created: linked with the /stack:65536
	option, or the /stack:65536 parameter applied using editbin later.
	For example, after applying the editbin /stacksize:65536 command to
	dyna.exe, I was able to successfully run the Dyna sample with 8000
	Client modules on my Win2K PC with 256M RAM (that means about 12000
	modules at runtime, including about 4000 dynamically created modules.)

2003-01-22  Andras Varga

	* ctypes.cc: increased type safety of Register_Function() and
	cFunctionType.

2003-01-20  Andras Varga

	* removed obsolete file cstk.cc

2003-01-19  Andras Varga

	* distrib.cc (new): contains implementations of distributions
	contributed by Werner Sandmann (TU Bonn): continuous distributions
	gamma_d(), beta(), erlang_k(), chi_square(), student_t(), cauchy(),
	triang(),lognormal(), weibull(), pareto_shifted(), and discrete
	distributions bernoulli(), binomial(), geometric(), negbinomial(),
	hypergeometric(), poisson()

	* random.cc (new), distrib.cc, util.cc: From util.cc, existing
	distributions (uniform, normal, exponential, etc) were moved to
	distrib.cc, and random number generator functions were moved to
	new file random.cc.

2003-01-14  Andras Varga

	* cwatch.cc: added support for 'bool'

	* cmessage.cc: foreach(): include encapsulated msg in traversal

	* cmodule.h: implemented cSimpleModule::waitAndEnqueue(); putAsideQueue
	(deprecated) prevented from being displayed in Tkenv.

2002-12-21  Andras Varga

	* cwatch.cc: for 'char *' and 'cObject *' types, cWatch::info()
	displays pointer value

2002-12-19  Andras Varga

	* always use <iostream> instead of <iostream.h>

	* module id notation in info() strings changed from '#nnn' to 'id=nnn'

2002-12-07  Andras Varga

	* cmessage.cc: info() now includes names of src/dest modules too;
	useful when displayed in Tkenv scheduled events or message window

2002-12-02  Andras Varga

	* cmessage.cc: par() methods to throw cException when object cannot
	be cast to cPar using dynamic_cast<cPar *>().

2002-11-14  Andras Varga

	* cmodule.cc: cSimpleModule::end() and deleteModule() are now driven
	by exceptions. This also means that activity() and handleMessage()
	execution immediately ends after the end() or deleteModule() call.
	(This fixes the bug that in previous versions, handleMessage() run
	through even after these calls.)

	* csimul.cc: cSimulation::doOneStep() restructured

2002-10-27  Andras Varga

	* object.cc: className() implemented using typeid (C++ RTTI)

	* chead.cc, ctypes.cc: inspectorfactory stuff moved to Tkenv from here

	* CRASH on Cygwin (gcc 2.95.3-5): if we transfer out (ie. by calling
	transferToMain()) from a try{..} block inside a coroutine, the
	program will crash during exiting (ie sometime on leaving main()).
	This is kind of bad, because that's the way activity() can be handled
	inside the simulation kernel, in cSimpleModule::activate()...

	To produce the bug, link with Tkenv any simulation that uses
	activity() (I tried with Fifo1 and Token). Do one (or more) events
	in Tkenv, then exit. Tkenv will crash right after printing
	"End run of OMNeT++". Then try the same without doing an event,
	or with pure handleMessage() simulation (ie Fifo2): neither will crash.
	Strangely enough, there is also no immediate crash if you do
	"Rebuild network" in Tkenv several times, crash is always delayed
	until program exit.

	To test it's really caused by the try block, modify cSimpleModule::
	activate(void *p), around cmodule.cc#575:
	    try
	    {
	        smod->activity();
	Insert simulation.transferToMain() just before the try block and
	try to reproduce the bug (one step in Tkenv, then exit). Simulation
	won't work, but no crash. Then move simulation.transferToMain()
	just inside the try block: simulation will (not) work same way
	as before, but crashes on exit.

	I only saw this on Cygwin: MSVC and gcc on Linux are OK. Web search
	told me that exception handling in Cygwin isn't thread-safe, hence
	the crash. According to some, recompiling *GCC* with --disable-shared
	and --enable-threads should cure this. I didn't test, converted to
	MinGW instead.

2002-10-20  Andras Varga

	* cgate.cc: added isConnectedOutside() and isConnectedInside() methods.

2002-10-19  Andras Varga

	* cmodule.cc, ctypes.cc, csimul.cc: refactoring around buildInside(),
	cNetworkType and Define_Network(), see include/ChangeLog.

	* cexception.cc, cmodule.cc, csimul.cc: introduced new cTermination-
	Exception, cEndModuleException classes

2002-10-09  Andras Varga

	* refactoring (see include/ChangeLog), cosmetics

2002-10-07  Andras Varga

	* cobject.cc, ctypes.cc, added onstartup.cc: refactoring: global
	registration lists now use EXECUTE_ON_STARTUP macro, see
	include/ChangeLog for more info.

2002-10-04  Andras Varga

	* error handling with exceptions has been refined.

	* csimul.cc: incEventCount() removed, incrementing event count
	was moved into doOneEvent()

	* csimul.h: several methods removed from cSimulation and moved
	into the Envir library: timeLimit(), simTimeLimit(), startClock(),
	stopClock(), resetClock(), checkTimes().

2002-09-07 Andras Varga

	* added cchannel.cc, modified carray.cc, cgate.cc, cmessage.cc,
	cmodule.cc, csimul.cc, mpimod.cc, mpipack.cc, netpack.cc, pvmmod.cc,
	pvmpack.cc: introduced channel objects -- see include/ChangeLog for
	more details

2002-07-08  Andras Varga

	* coutvect.cc (cOutVector methods): register vector as early as
	possible. This is needed by the Akaroa output vector manager because
	Akaroa needs to know the total number of parameters before recording
	the first value. (This change has the side effect that empty vectors
	also get declared in the output vector file, which is redundant.)

2002-07-04  Andras Varga

	* cdispstr.h added: utility class cDisplayString

2002-07-03  Andras Varga

	* csimul.cc (doOneEvent()): bugfix: added missing ev.messageDelivered()
	call that could cause a "phantom" message being animated in Tkenv with
	handleMessage()-based simple modules

2002-06-27  Andras Varga

	* cexception.cc/h added; most opp_error() calls replaced with
	throw new cException(...). Exceptions are caught in
	cSimpleModule::activate() (for activity()-based modules) and
	in cSimulation::doOneEvent() (for handleMessage()-based modules),
	and converted to 'conventional' opp_error().

	* TBD: rethink error handling wrt exceptions!

2002-06-24  Andras Varga

	* ccoroutine.h/cc: use Fiber API on Windows

2002-06-17  Andras Varga

	* cpar.cc: new feature: cPar can use compiled expressions subclassed
	from cDoubleExpression (new class). This is needed for code generated
	by the new, nedxml-based nedc.

2002-05-28  Frank Paehlke  <paehlke@tm.uni-karlsruhe.de>

	* cdensity.cc, chist.cc, cksplit.cc, cmodule.cc, cobject.cc,
	cpar.cc, cpsquare.cc, csimul.cc, cstat.cc, ctypes.cc, cvarhist.cc:
	do not include iostream.h et.al. directly (already included by
	header files)

	* cmessage.cc (decapsulate): added check for encapmsg==0 before
	accessing encapmsg->len

2002-05-16  Ulrich Kaage  <kaage@int.uni-karlsruhe.de>

	* mpi/mpimod.h (class cNetGate): fixed className() declaration
	(class cMpiMod): dito.

	* pvm/pvmmod.h (class cNetGate): fixed className() declaration
	(class cPvmMod): dito.

2002-05-04  ------ omnetpp-2.2 released ------

2002-04-07  Ulrich Kaage  <kaage@int.uni-karlsruhe.de>

	* pvm/pvmpack.cc (upack_object): compile fix: cast from (void*) to
	(cObject*) in call to createOne()

2002-03-05  Andras Varga

	* cgate.cc (setDisplayString): connection display string changes now
	take effect immediately. Implementation: notify parent module's
	inspector. (This is should not be the final solution though; it would
	be better to add displayStringChanged() methods to cEnvir...)

2002-03-04  Andras Varga

	* cObject::free(cObject *) renamed to dealloc() throughout to avoid
	misunderstandings

	* coutvect.cc: vector registration made on-demand to allow initial
	setName() calls

	* cobject.cc, cmodule.cc, cgate.cc, cpar.cc, csimul.cc: fullPath2()
	renamed to fullPath(); see include/ChangeLog for details. fullName()
	methods in cGate and cModule also changed (no longer use static buffer).

2002-03-03  Andras Varga

	* several delete operators replaced with delete []. [suggestion by
	Johnny Lai]

2002-03-03  Andras Varga

	* ctypes.cc: cClassRegister can now be used to create instances of
	non-cObject classes too; as part of this change, createOne() return
	value changed from cObject* to void*. (See also include/ChangeLog)

	* csimul.cc, coutvect.cc: management of various output files
	(output vector file, output scalar file, snapshot file) was moved
	from cSimulation to the user interface library (behind the ev facade).
	Implementation of cOutVector changed completely. The cOutFileMgr
	class was removed altogether. (See also include/ChangeLog)

	* cpar.cc: valueChanges() renamed to beforeChange(); corresponding
	afterChange() method added. Removed parameter change logging code.
	(See also include/ChangeLog)

2002-02-24  Andras Varga

	* cmodule.cc: bugfix: pause() was allowed for handleMessage() modules
	too.

2002-02-22  Ulrich Kaage  <kaage@int.uni-karlsruhe.de>

	* cllist.cc (operator=): Same bugs as with cQueue (see items
	2002-02-21 and 2001-10-25). Same bugfixes applied [reported by
	#JIA KE# <P147125331@ntu.edu.sg>]

2002-02-21  Ulrich Kaage  <kaage@int.uni-karlsruhe.de>

	* cqueue.cc (operator=): Bugfix: iteration order changed from
	head->tail to tail->head. Since unsorted insertion is performed at
	the destination queue's head, this preserves element order. Fix
	provided by Jos� Afonso <jaa@dei.uminho.pt>

2002-02-11  Ulrich Kaage  <kaage@int.uni-karlsruhe.de>

	* cmodule.cc (moduleByRelativePath): use explicit constructor
	instead of copy constructor for pathbuf (gcc-3 patch)
	* csimul.cc (moduleByPath): ditto

2002-01-24  Ulrich Kaage  <kaage@int.uni-karlsruhe.de>

	* cenum.cc (insert): Bugfix: iterating to the next larger
	allocation table size failed. New table size was always 0
	(insert): check that enum strings have different keys. Otherwise
	abort
	(insert): use opp_error instead of fprintf for error messages

2002-01-23 Andras Varga

	* cmodule.cc: bugfix: send..() and scheduleAt() crashed if message
	owner was set to NULL.

	* carray.cc: get() methods of cArray and cBag no longer give a warning
	if the slot is empty, but simply return NULL pointer. Warnings remained
	only in the remove() methods.

2001-11-06 Andras Varga

	* csimul.cc: bugfix: startRun() unnecessarily disabled warnings

2001-10-28 Andras Varga

	* util.cc: opp_strprettytrunc() added; indexedname() renamed to
	opp_mkindexedname() (old name still exists as macro)
	* cobject.cc, cmodule.cc, csimul.cc, cgate.cc, cpar.cc: added
	fullPath2(buffer,buflen) which produces the result in an external
	buffer; cObject::fullPath() now relies on fullPath2().

2001-10-25  Ulrich Kaage  <kaage@int.uni-karlsruhe.de>

	* cqueue.cc (operator=): Bugfix for stop condition in iteration
	loop

2001-09-14 Andras Varga

	* utils.cc: added opp_nextrand(long& seed)
	* cmodule.cc: display string methods reorganized

2001-09-06 Andras Varga

	* cleanup around object copying (see include/ChangeLog for details)

2001-09-01 Andras Varga

	* _CONST patches made permanent: _CONST --> const, CONSTCAST() -->
	const_cast<>() replacements

	* Makefile.bc: cenum.cc, cstruct.cc added

2001-08-30 Andras Varga

	* MPI targets added to Makefile.vc too

2001-08-11 Andras Varga

	* added _CONSTs to all copy constructors, operator=()'s and dup()'s

2001-08-06  Ulrich Kaage  <kaage@int.uni-karlsruhe.de>

	* cnetmod.cc (isLocalMachineIn): Compile-Fix: changed const to
	_CONST in argument list.

2001-08-05 Andras Varga

	* added a few dozen new _CONSTs; affects nearly all files

2001-07-29 Andras Varga

	* added a bunch of _CONSTs (see changelog entry in include/)

2001-07-11 Andras Varga

	* mpi/* added, Makefile.in: Eric Wu's Tru64/MPI port

2001-07-02 Andras Varga

	* cenum.cc,cstruct.cc: fixed, added to makefile.in and makefile.vc.
	Dependencies to be updated in both makefiles! Code still untested.

2001-06-28  Andras Varga

	* cstruct.cc added: classes to support self-describing data structures,
	to be used for implementing message subclassing. UNTESTED. To be added
	to the makefile.

	* cenum.cc added: classes to support string mapping of enums. UNTESTED.
	To be added to the makefile.

2001-06-20  Ulrich Kaage  <kaage@int.uni-karlsruhe.de>

	* Makefile.in (depend): added -I../../include

	* carray.cc (): const patches
	added functions:
	        const void *cBag::get(int m) const
	        const cObject *cArray::get(int m) const
	        const cObject *cArray::get(const char *objname) const

	* cgate.cc (): const patches

	* cmessage.cc (): const patches

	* cmodule.cc (): const patches
	added functions:
	        cGate *cModule::gate(const char *s, int sn) const

	* cobject.cc (): const patches

	* cpar.cc (): const patches

2001-03-10 Andras Varga

	* ------ omnetpp-2.1 released ------

	* Borland C++ support removed: I deleted the project files
	(*.ide). I added equivalent Makefile.bc files (generated from the
	BC IDE), but they are completely unsupported at the moment. If
	there's interest, it's possible that later I'll add makefiles for
	the free command-line bc5.5 compiler.

2001-02-27 Andras Varga

	* fixed bug which prevented compiling with PVM

	* ------ omnetpp-2.0p1 released ------

2001-02-06 Andras Varga

	* fix: Makefile.vc: 'clean' target didn't delete object files in std/ and pvm/

	* ------ omnetpp-2.0 released ------

2001-02-05 Andras Varga

	* ev<< and ev>> now supports cPar objects too [from Nicky van Foreest]

	* old BC3.1 support removed from cenvir.h

2001-01-24 Andras Varga

	* bugfix: cArray and cBag didn't work properly after clear()

	* bugfix: makefile and makefile.vc didn't handle PVM properly
	[reported by Ahmet Sekercioglu]

2001-01-16 Andras Varga

	* added OMNETPP_VERSION to defs.h (0x0200 for OMNeT++ 2.0)

2001-01-15 Andras Varga

	* bugfix: cQueue::insertBefore() and cQueue::insertAfter() didn't
	take the ownership of the inserted object [reported by Ulrich
	Kaage]

2001-01-03 Andras Varga

	* number of cQueue methods made virtual to enable customizing
	cQueue (e.g. adding statistics for maintaining average queue
	length, etc.)  [suggested by Holger Karl]

	* added static counters to the cMessage class (total_msgs,
	live_msgs); these variables are incremented/decremented by the
	cMessage constructor and destructor, and displayed in Tkenv. They
	can be very handy at checking for memory leaks.

	* changed the place where cSimpleModule's timeoutmsg is created:
	from the constructor to scheduleStart() which is also mandatorily
	called for activity() modules. Reason: "Total msgs" count in Tkenv
	incorrectly displayed zero at the beginning of the simulation,
	while the activation/timeout msg objects already existed)

2000-06-04 Andras Varga

	* ------ omnetpp-2.0b5 released ------

	* fix: cPar::setfunction() improved and made const-correct (for gcc 2.95.2)

	* warnings eliminated from cllist.cc & coutvect.cc

2000-05-21 Andras Varga

	* ------ omnetpp-2.0b4 released ------

	* added message sending functions which take cGate* pointers
	[suggested by Mark Rahner]:
	int send(cMessage *msg, cGate *outputgate);
	int sendDelayed(cMessage *msg, double delay, cGate *outputgate);
	int sendDirect(cMessage *msg, double delay, cGate *inputgate);

	(Mark's original suggestion was to create a single generalized
	send(cMessage *msg, double delay, cGate *gate) function which
	would combine the functionality of all other
	send()/sendDelayed()/sendDirect() variants, and mark other
	functions as 'deprecated'. The gate passed to send() could be that
	of another module [~sendDirect()] and either an input or an output
	gate; the delay argument would be interpreted as propagation delay
	until the msg reaches that gate. I didn't implement it for now
	because I felt such a very general function would cause confusion
	for simulation programmers, but I'd like to hear more opinions
	about this...)

	* multi-stage initialization support added. Modules have two new
	functions which can be redefined by the user:

	void initialize(int stage);
	int numInitStages();

	At the beginning of the simulation, initialize(0) is called for
	all modules, then initialize(1), initialize(2), etc. For each
	module, numInitStages() must be redefined to return the number of
	init stages required, e.g. for a two-stage init, numInitStages()
	should return 2, and initialize(int stage) must be implemented to
	handle the stage=0 and stage=1 cases.  callInitialize() now
	performs the full multi-stage initialization for that module and
	all its submodules.

	Multi-stage initialization defaults to the good old single-stage
	initialize() function (without args): the default numInitStages()
	returns 1, and the default initialize(int stage) simply calls
	initialize().

2000-05-19 Andras Varga

	* fixed a bug in cSimulation::snapshot() which caused segfault if
	snapshot() was called with no 'label' parameter [reported by
	Gy. Pongor]

	* fixed a bug which caused double printing of the distribution
	data in histogram classes when snapshot() was called

2000-05-07 Andras Varga

	* Makefile.vc improvements [from Balazs Kelemen]

2000-05-06 Andras Varga

	* further char * --> const char * changes

	* displayString() added to cMessage. By default it returns an
	empty string; users have to subclass cMessage and redefine
	displayString() to get messages with custom appearance in
	Tkenv. (Not implemented yet in Tkenv!)

2000-05-05 Andras Varga

	* setDisplayString() now works in Tkenv (sim/cmodule.cc also
	affected)

	* setDisplayString() got a new argument, bool immediate.  It
	specifies whether the display string change should take effect
	immediately, or only after processing the current event (default
	is immediate=true).  If several display string changes are going
	to be done within one event, then immediate=false is useful
	because it reduces the number of necessary
	redraws. Immediate=false also uses less stack. But its drawback is
	that a setDisplayString() followed by a send() would actually be
	displayed in reverse order (message animation first), because
	message animations are performed immediately (actually within the
	send() call).

	* once we have setDisplayString(), seems like we'll need a display
	string parser/assembler object to be able to easily change
	specific values within the display string without bothering the
	rest of it. Maybe for the some next version; but if you want to
	contribute one, go ahead :-)

2000-04-19 Andras Varga

	* bugfix: when using datarate and propagation delay at the same
	output gate, the gate's transmissionFinishes() function returned
	incorrect value: one had to substract the propagation delay to get
	the correct number.  Fixed in cGate::deliver(cMessage *msg):
	transmission delay calculation should be done _before_ propagation
	delay.

	* in util.h, fastconcat() renamed to opp_concat(); compatibility
	#define added

2000-04-10 Andras Varga

	* TRUE/FALSE (defines) replaced by true/false (C++ keywords)

	* operator=(cXXX& other) functions now include this line: if
	(this==&other) return *this;

	* indentation canonized (4 spaces) in most files (where I had the patience)

	* remove(cObject *) added to cArray

	* cArray error handling improved

	* Improved on functions for traversing module hierarchy. [suggestion by Niko]

	These functions were removed from cSimulation:
	      int find(const char *modulename,int index=-1, int parentmod_id=-1);
	      cModule *module(const char *modulename,int index=-1,int parentmod_id=-1);
	      bool isUnique(const char *s);  // not needed
	      int find(cModule *mod);  // was equivalent to mod->id()

	The first two have been replaced by functions in cModule:
	      int findSubmodule(const char *submodname, int idx=-1); // moduleID (or -1)
	      cModule *submodule(const char *submodname, int idx=-1);

	New function in cModule:
	      cModule *moduleByRelativePath(const char *path);

	moduleByRelativePath() is similar to cSimulation::moduleByPath(),
	except that it starts the search at that module
	(e.g. mymod->moduleByRelativePath( "sub.subsub") returns the
	"subsub" submodule of the "sub" submodule of mymod).

	* in printf() statements, all "%lf","%lg","%le" were replaced by "%f","%g","%e"

	* in cmodule.h, the old NEW and DELETE macros (for raw memory
	allocation) were renamed to opp_new and opp_free. (Beware when
	using opp_free: it does NOT call the destructor of the passed
	object!)

2000-04-06 Andras Varga

	* Changes to enable linking a Windows DLL from the library. Note
	that the sim dll and envir.dll mutually depend on each other, so
	first we must build an import library from one to be able to link
	dlls from them. Thus, first we create envir.ilib [ilib=import
	library], then we can link sim_std.dll, and using sim_std.ilib we
	can link envir.dll...

	On Unix we don't have this problem: .so files are not linked
	against other libs (they are treated more like a collection of
	object files), and the dynamic loader acts practically as a linker
	and collects the symbols at runtime from the different .so files.

	* Remaining problem on Win32: user interface DLL cannot be loaded
	dynamically
	(e.g. with [General]/load-libs= ini file setting); the
	LoadLibrary() call returns error code. The problem is [probably]
	with the static objects in the DLL whose constructors are called
	[probably] during LoadLibrary() from DllMain(); these constructors
	want to write a global variable located outside the DLL. This was
	no problem on Unix but seems like Windows doesn't like it. To be
	verified that the error is really caused by this and not something
	else!!!

2000-03-28 Andras Varga

	* SIM_API macro added to public classes and functions to export
	them on Windows

2000-03-26 Andras Varga

	* 'char *' pointers made const-correct (lots of 'char *' -->
	'const char *' replacements throughout the code) -- this will
	affect the UI libraries too

	* header files indentation uniformized; other little cleanups,
	e.g. some method parameter names made mode descriptive

2000-03-12 Andras Varga

	* pvm files really fixed. Debugging done by Gabor Lencse.

	* sum() and sqrSum() members added to statistics classes (cStdDev& subclasses)

	* cPar fix: boolValue(), longValue() and doubleValue() made rather
	liberal: now they all allow conversion from all of B,L and the
	double types D,T,X,F.  This is necessary because of the way
	parameter assignments in NED are handled. For example, bool and
	long expressions (e.g. "i==0 || i==n") are compiled into cPar X
	expressions which will _need_ to be converted to bool/long after
	evaluation.

	* isNumeric() added to cPar

2000-02-03 Andras Varga

	* some pvm-related bugs fixed.

2000-01-25 Andras Varga

	* ------ omnetpp-2.0b3 released ------

	* cArray functions changed to take and return cArray* instead of
	cArray&.  This affects add(), addAt(), remove(), get() and op[].

2000-01-17 Andras Varga

	* The +,-,*,/,... operators which take cPar plus a numeric type
	(long/double) were removed from cpar.h. This affects some existing
	code: expressions like msg->par("count")+1 which used to compile
	now cause error ("too many possible conversions") and must be
	disabiguated by adding explicit casts like this:
	(int)msg->par("count")+1.

	Assigments (like: cPar p = 1; int i=p;) still work fine and don't
	need to be changed.

	The reason is that the ANSI C++ overload resolution rules have
	changed a few years ago, and now that compilers begin to be more
	compliant, it is difficult (~impossible) to write operator*/+-()
	functions with which code will compile well under both the old and
	the new resolution rules (which are likely to coexist for a few
	years to come). Ambiguity comes because cPar supports many
	conversions (double, int, long, unsigned int, unsigned long,
	char * [char* + int is also legal!], void *, etc.)  I feel that it is
	better(results in cleaner code) to use explicit type casts in
	expressions with cPar.

	This issue came up while porting to MSVC 6.0, see MSVC error C2666.

2000-01-15 Andras Varga

	* the 'explicit' keyword was added to a number of constructors,
	most notably cPar(char *name). The reason was that constructs like

	cPar p = "foo";

	did NOT compile as one would expect (i.e. to a cPar() construction
	followed by an assignment), but to a cPar p("foo") constructor
	call, which is quite different! ("foo" becomes the object's NAME
	instead of its value.)  The explicit keyword is supported to
	prevent this from happening.

	* minor change: cSimulation::setErrorCode() added (was needed in
	Tkenv's startup code)

2000-01-04 Andras Varga

	* cPar::setStringValue() now accepts NULL (and treats it as "")

1999-12-19 Andras Varga

	* cPar interface cleaned up:

	o overloaded setValue(..) functions were renamed to
	setStringValue(..), setLongValue(..), setBoolValue(..), etc., and
	the type character was deleted from their arg list. This was done
	to be consistent with the getter functions which already had the
	names stringValue(), longValue() etc., and to make client code
	more readable by eliminating "magic constants" (the type
	characters). This shouldn't affect much existing code, most users
	prefer assignment operator to these functions.

	o redirection handling functions were changed to:
	setRedirection(cPar*), isRedirected(), cPar* redirection(),
	cancelRedirection(). This results in more readable client
	code. These functions are hardly used in any user code.

	o the number of constructors was reduced to 3 by deleting the ones
	which set an initial long,string,etc. value. Prior to this cPar
	had 16 constructors which made subclassing very
	cumbersome. Functionality is not lost because the user can write
	code like

	  cPar par("par") = 5L;
	Existing client code like
	  msg->addPar( *new cPar("dest", 'L', dest );
	can be rewritten like
	  msg->addPar( *new cPar("dest") = dest );
	or better like
	   msg->addPar("dest") = dest;

	Note that the two new and better forms have been available for a
	long time, so the change should not affect much existing code.

	o  conversons to/from bool were not fully supported

	* convenience function hasPar(char*) added to cMessage

	* convenience functions hasPar(char*) and hasGate(char*,int) added
	to cModule

	* cQueue and cLinkedList interfaces changed:

	insertHead(a) --> insert(a) (the name was misleading: cQueue can
	act as priority queue and inserted elements aren't necessarily put
	at the head)

	peekTail()    --> tail()
	peekHead()    --> head()     (shorter names are preferred)

	get(a)        --> remove(a)  (the "get" word was misleading as it didn't

	imply that the element is actually removed from the queue)

	getTail()     --> pop()      ("get was misleading, see above;

	"pop" is used in other libs such as STL or Java for this operation)

	getHead() removed            (it can be expressed as q.remove(q.head()))

	Compatibility #defines added to defs.h for insertHead(a),
	peekTail(), peekHead(), getTail().

1999-12-18 Andras Varga

	* renamed isA() to className() in cObject and derived classes.  A
	compatibility #define was temporarily added to defs.h to ease
	migration.

	* in cMessage, isbad() renamed to hasBitError(), isgood() removed,
	and setError() renamed to setBitError()

	* macro names in module interface declarations (Interface...End)
	changed to reduce chance of name clashes. This is internal to
	OMNeT++ and does not affect user code.

1999-12-05 Andras Varga

	* Makefile.vc added

1999-12-04 Andras Varga

	* compiled with MSVC. Minor changes: changed int to bool, struct
	to class in some places. sim_std.dsp added. NOTE: one has to
	rename all .cc files to .cpp for compiling (ren *.cc *.cpp)!

1999-11-09 Andras Varga

	* iso c++ compatibility hack: in expressions like return s?s:""
	the "" needs a cast to char* (to cast away constness). Added a
	CONST_CAST() macro until the source is made fully const-correct,
	hopefully in the near future.

1999-10-06 Andras Varga

	* ------ omnetpp-2.0b2 released ------

	* isSelfMessage() member function added to cMessage. It tells if
	the message was sent (using a send..() function) or posted by a
	scheduleAt() call.

	* a new void* pointer was added to cMessage. The pointer is
	set/returned by the setContextPointer(void *p) and
	contextPointer() functions, and it can be used for any purpose by
	the simulation programmer. It is not used by the simulation
	kernel, and it is treated as a mere pointer (no memory mgmt is
	done on it). Intended purpose: a module which schedules several
	self-messages (timers) will need to identify a self-message when
	it arrives back to the module, ie. the module will have to
	determine which timer went off and what to do then. The context
	pointer can be made to point at a data structure kept by the
	module which can carry enough "context" information about the
	event.

	* Remaining -Wall warnings: "%lf", "%lg", "%le" in printf format strings.

1999-09-23 Andras Varga

	* callInitialize() and scheduleStart() swapped in cSimulation's
	startRun() to support send()/scheduleAt() in initialize() to
	modules with activity().

	* same change made to createInitStart(), and it was renamed to
	createScheduleInit() to reflect the new order of what it does.

1999-09-20 Andras Varga

	* bug fixed in cWeightedStdDev::collect2(): cStdDev::collect() was
	called with val instead of weight*val.

	* bug fixed with misplaced ev.messageDelivered() calls in the
	receiveNewOn() function

	* cOutVector::record() corrected: it should update the inspector
	even if it doesn't write to file

1999-09-07 Andras Varga

	* ------ omnetpp-2.0b released ------

	* initialize() and finish() moved to cModule, so you can define
	them also for compound modules

	* callInitialize() and callFinish() are also in cModule; they are
	defined in compound modules to recursively call themselves for
	submodules.  callInitialize() for the compound module is called
	_before_, callFinish() is called _after_ the call on submodules.

1999-09-06 Andras Varga

	* a couple of unsigned<-->signed changes (mostly in the statistics
	classes) to reduce the number of "gcc -Wall" warnings

1999-09-05 Andras Varga

	* cSimpleModule's initialize(), activity(), handleMessage(),
	finish() made protected members so that they cannot be called
	directly by user code.

	* callInitialize() was added to cSimpleModule to enable calling
	initialize() from user code; callInitialize() was also added for
	cModule and cCompoundModule so that it can be used
	polimorphically.

	* added cModuleType::createInitStart(char *namestr, cModule
	*parentmod) convenience function to get a module up and running in
	one step.  Does
	create()+buildInside()+callInitialize()+scheduleStart(now).
	Should work for both simple and compound modules.

	Not applicable if the module:

	- has parameters to be set
	- gate vector sizes to be set
	- gates to be connected before initialize()

	Now a simple module can be created on the fly by simply saying:
	  mod = modtype->createAndInit("name",this);
	  mod->scheduleStart( simTime() );

1999-09-01 Andras Varga

	* behavior of scheduleStart() changed: now it can be called (and
	does nothing) for modules using handleMessage(). The benefit is
	that this way code that creates simple modules dynamically doesn't
	have to know whether the module is using activity() or
	handleMessage(); the same code (which contains a call to
	scheduleStart()) can be used for both.

	* activate() [the boot procedure for simple module activity()] now
	checks if the message that starts the module is really a starter
	message (and not some other msg). This way, bugs caused by leaving
	out scheduleStart() for dynamically created modules can be
	detected.

	* wait() now makes sure it is called for a module using activity()
	and not handleMessage().

	* cModuleType now caches the cModuleInterface pointer. (Before it
	looked up the interface each time, based on the interface name.)

1999-08-30 Andras Varga

	* bool isScheduled() member added to cMessage: can be used to
	examine whether the message is in the Future Event Set

	* cancelEvent() behaviour changed: now it causes an error if the
	message is not in the Future Event Set. One should write code like
	this:

	if (msg->isScheduled())
	     delete cancelEvent(msg);
	else
	     // ???

	Or rather:
	 if (msg->isScheduled())
	     delete cancelEvent(msg);
	 else if (putAsideQueue.contains(msg))
	     delete putAsideQueue.get(msg);
	 else
	     // ???

	* cQueue::isEnqueued(cObject *) renamed to cQueue::contains(cObject *)

	* cLinkedList::isInList(void *) renamed to cLinkedList::contains(void *)

1999-08-02 Andras Varga

	* fixed the bug with randseed() [it was an error to call it
	without an argument] and split randseed(long seed=0) into 2
	functions: randseed() and randseed(long seed).

	* fixed the bug in intrand(r) and genk_intrand(r) that caused
	division by zero if called with r==0; now r<=0 values cause
	runtime error

	* INTRAND_MAX corrected to 2**31-2

1999-07-10 Andras Varga

	* fixed bug in cQueue and cLinkedList (didn't always increment
	item count on insertion)

	* fixed bug in cPar::info(): didn't handle boolean (B) type

1999-01-26  Andras Varga

	* some cleanup

1999-01-26  Andras Varga

	* calls to simulation.error() replaced by opp_error() to avoid
	having to #include csimul.cc (and half the sim. kernel with it) in
	each file; similar for opp_warning() and
	opp_terminate(). opp_terminate() is similar to opp_error(), only
	it does not include the word "error" in the message.

	* requires updated Envir and user interface libraries

1999-01-26  Andras Varga

	* recordScalar() for recording strings added

1999-01-25  Andras Varga

	* small fixes

1998-06-19  Andras Varga

	* cMessage::creationTime() added

	* mystr...() functions renamed to opp_str...()
	(for compatibility, mystr... names are #defined to opp_str...)

	* ASSERT() added (similar to the assert() macro, also disappears
	with NDEBUG)

	* scalar file behavior corrected (only writes file if there's
	something to write)

	* cPar: new type void* added ('P'), old 'P' type (cObject *) was
	renamed to 'O'. Funcs: cObject *objectValue(), void
	*pointerValue() Memory management of void*: configPointer(...)
	func, similar to cLinkedList's method.

1998-06-19  Andras Varga

	* Now deleteModule() can also delete the currently executing

	* underflow/overflow cells removed (but underflow/overflow counts
	still maintained)

	* cKSplit cleaned up a little

	* saveToFile()/loadFromFile() file formats cleaned up and loading

1998-04-26  Andras Varga

	* makefile can now create shared objects (libsim_std.so,

1998-04-24  Andras Varga

	* 2 bugs fixed

1998-04-14  Andras Varga

	* cModule: setDisplayString(type,str) and displayString(type)
	added.  type: dispSUBMOD or dispENCLOSINGMOD cGate:
	setDisplayString(str) and displayString() correspond to the
	display string of the connection starting from that gate.  The
	values of these strings will come from GNED through NED's
	"display:" phrases, and they will hold information about how the
	module should be displayed in Tkenv or other GUI
	animation/interactive simulation tool.  The exact format of the
	strings are documented in GNED's version.log.

	* cModule: gatev, paramv made public (because of the
	inspectors...)

1998-02-15  Andras Varga

	* cSimpleModule::finish() function added -- user can redefine it
	and it will be called at the end of the simulation run

	* 'lib' prepended to library names under Unix - now they can le
	linked with

	  *lsim_std or -lsim_pvm option

	renamed to !.

1997-12-29  Andras Varga

	* 'cHead members' moved from cSimpleModule to cModule

	* cModuleType::create() modified so that it automatically puts
	member objects of module classes to the members list, so there's
	no need to do setOwner(&members) calls from the constructor.
	(However, they do no harm if they are there.)

	* module IDs made unique during whole simulation: old IDs are no
	longer reused.

1997-12-29  Andras Varga

	* strToSimtime0() function added

	* cPar::setFromText() rewritten: better & more consistent error
	handling, more informative error messages supports writing time
	units in ini files: Net.Gen.stop_at = 1h 30m Net.Gen.ia_time =
	uniform(10s,15s)

	* comments added to ctypes.cc

1997-12-13  Andras Varga

	* renamings for clarity:

	   cModule:
	     subscript() --> id()
	     setSubscript() --> setId()
	   cGate:
	     ownerGate --> id()
	     setlink --> setLink()
	   cMessage:
	     sentFromModule() --> senderModuleId()
	     sentFromGate() --> senderGateId()

	* corrected cells() in all classes to return 0 if not transformed
	yet

	  cObj *peektail(), cObj *peekhead()
	  cObj *get(cObj *obj), cObj *gettail(), gethead()

1997-08-17  Andras Varga

	* insertordr added to cMsg and cMsgHeap. This way messages with
	the same times and priorities can be retreived from the message

	* Changes in PVM stuff:

	  - debugged by Gabor Lencse: fixes in csimul.cc and pvm/pvmmod.cc

	  - SINGLE_HOST #define added to pvmmod.cc: if turned on, OMNeT++
	  runs all segments of a distributed simulation on the local host,
	  to facilitate debugging. (Needs PVM running though!)

	  - stopping a distributed simulation doesn't work yet
