2015-07-20  ------ omnetpp-5.0b2 released ------

2015-06-16  Andras Varga

	* Cleanup: prefer ++it to it++ (less copying)

2015-06-08  Andras Varga

	* Cleanup: longer header guards

2015-06-11  Andras Varga

	* if(dynamic_cast) refactoring: change code like

	    if (dynamic_cast<cComponent *>(object) != nullptr) {
	        cComponent *component = (cComponent *)object;
	        ...
	    }

	To:

	    if (cComponent *component = dynamic_cast<cComponent *>(object)) {
	        ...
	    }

2015-06-08  Andras Varga

	* Cleanup: code formatting

2015-05-15  Andras Varga

	* Cleanup: use per-folder nested namespaces: omnetpp::envir, omnetpp::tkenv,
	omnetpp::layout, omnetpp::common, omnetpp::eventlog, etc.

2015-05-22  Andras Varga

	* Modernizing: added the 'override' keyword (C++11) to overridden methods;
	it becomes blank when using with an older compiler.

2015-05-21  Rudolf Hornig

	* Modernizing: replaced NULLs by 'nullptr' (C++11); it is defined as 0
	when using an older compiler.

2015-05-11  Andras Varga

	* Cleanup: data members renamed to camelCase

2015-04-20  Andras Varga

2015-04-12  Andras Varga

	* Cleanup: copyright years updated

2015-04-08  Andras Varga

	* Modernizing:

	- Use a fixed include path (-Iinclude -Isrc) for all source folders
	  under src/, and qualify cross-folder #includes with the folder
	  name (e.g. change #include "stringutil.h" to #include "common/stringutil.h").
	  This increases readbility and reduces the chance of including a wrong
	  header.

	- In source files, sort #include statements by folder.

2015-03-04  ------ omnetpp-5.0b1 released ------

2014-01-28  Andras Varga

2009-02-27  ------ omnetpp-4.0rc2 released ------

	* library renamed to oppeventlog

2008-02-23  Andras Varga

	* Started the ChangeLog. The Eventlog library was added in omnetpp-4.0.
	It implements reading and traversing eventlog files recorded by
	simulations, and also provides a command-line tool (eventlogtool).
	Files >2GB are supported. The lib is used by Sequence Charts
	in the IDE. Author: Levente Meszaros.
