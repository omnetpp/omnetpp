2017-04-06  Andras Varga

	* Modernizing: use C++11's range-based for loops where applicable, using
	clang-tidy's modernize-loop-convert.

	* Modernizing: replace INT64_PRINTF_FORMAT and LL with C++11's PRId64.
	Note: PRId64 includes the "d" that was not part of INT64_PRINTF_FORMAT
	alias LL.

2017-05-25  Rudolf Hornig

	* Updated makefiles for speeding up the build:
	- generated files are created only once, even when using parallel build
	- binaries are copied to their final destination using proper makefile
	  targets

2017-05-08  ------ omnetpp-5.1.1 released ------

2017-03-31  ------ omnetpp-5.1 released ------

2016-11-30  Rudolf Hornig

	* build: Makefile refactored. Added clang-c2 support and optimized
	the build process.

	* build: removed Makefile.vc, as Visual C++ builds are now handled
	by the standard Makefiles.

2016-07-25  Andras Varga

	* Added 'discard' field to SendHopEntry in eventlogentries.txt.
	See related cEnvir::messageSendHop() change in the simulation
	kernel.

2016-06-23  Rudolf Hornig

	* The makefile now uses compiler-generated dependency files.

2016-04-13  ------ omnetpp-5.0 released ------

2016-04-06  Levente Meszaros

	* Fixed a bug that broke transmission delay drawing in the sequence chart

2015-11-23  Levente Meszaros

	* Support for fingerprint recording: added 'fingerprint' to EventEntry,
	see eventlogentries.txt.

2015-10-16  Andras Varga

	* omnetpp namespace made permanent (cannot be turned off):
	- removed configure option and preprocessor symbol USE_NAMESPACE
	- removed related macros: NAMESPACE_BEGIN, NAMESPACE_END,
	  USING_NAMESPACE, OPP, OPP_STR, OPP_PREFIX etc.

2015-07-20  ------ omnetpp-5.0b2 released ------

2015-06-16  Andras Varga

	* Cleanup: prefer ++it to it++ (less copying)

2015-06-08  Andras Varga

	* Cleanup: longer header guards

2015-06-11  Andras Varga

	* if(dynamic_cast) refactoring: change code like

	    if (dynamic_cast<cComponent *>(object) != nullptr) {
	        cComponent *component = (cComponent *)object;
	        ...
	    }

	To:

	    if (cComponent *component = dynamic_cast<cComponent *>(object)) {
	        ...
	    }

2015-06-08  Andras Varga

	* Cleanup: code formatting

2015-05-15  Andras Varga

	* Cleanup: use per-folder nested namespaces: omnetpp::envir, omnetpp::tkenv,
	omnetpp::layout, omnetpp::common, omnetpp::eventlog, etc.

2015-05-22  Andras Varga

	* Modernizing: added the 'override' keyword (C++11) to overridden methods;
	it becomes blank when using with an older compiler.

2015-05-21  Rudolf Hornig

	* Modernizing: replaced NULLs by 'nullptr' (C++11); it is defined as 0
	when using an older compiler.

2015-05-11  Andras Varga

	* Cleanup: data members renamed to camelCase

2015-04-20  Andras Varga

	* Cleanup: use C++ names of C headers (e.g. <cstdio> instead of <stdio.h>)

2015-04-12  Andras Varga

	* Cleanup: copyright years updated

2015-04-08  Andras Varga

	* Modernizing:

	- Use a fixed include path (-Iinclude -Isrc) for all source folders
	  under src/, and qualify cross-folder #includes with the folder
	  name (e.g. change #include "stringutil.h" to #include "common/stringutil.h").
	  This increases readbility and reduces the chance of including a wrong
	  header.

	- In source files, sort #include statements by folder.

2015-03-04  ------ omnetpp-5.0b1 released ------

2014-01-28  Andras Varga

	* Removed eventlog support for module reparenting (i.e. logging of
	cModule::changeParentTo()), because tools cannot easily support it

	* Fixed handling eventlog-recording-intervals, recording stopped at the first non recorded
	event and did not start afterwards.

	* library renamed to oppeventlog

2008-02-23  Andras Varga

	* Started the ChangeLog. The Eventlog library was added in omnetpp-4.0.
	It implements reading and traversing eventlog files recorded by
	simulations, and also provides a command-line tool (eventlogtool).
	Files >2GB are supported. The lib is used by Sequence Charts
	in the IDE. Author: Levente Meszaros.
