2022-04-11  ------ omnetpp-6.0 released ------

2022-04-07  Attila Torok

	* Fix Doxygen grouping of functions and macros

2022-04-06  Andras Varga

	* SqliteVectorFileWriter: fix memory leak found by AddressSanitizer
	(VectorData were leaked).

2022-04-06  Andras Varga

	* expression.y: fix memory leak found by AddressSanitizer

2022-04-06  Andras Varga

	* expression.y: eliminate UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer warning in
	double->int64_t conversion.

2022-04-05  Andras Varga

	* UnitConversion: eliminate "signed integer overflow" reported by
	UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer

2022-03-22  Levente Mészáros

	* BigDecimal: avoid overflow in PowersOfTenInitializer

2022-01-27  Andras Varga

	* stringutil.h: added opp_isvalididentifier()

2021-12-10  Andras Varga

	* PushDir: improve error reporting

2021-11-30  Andras Varga

	* Expression: Add evaluateForType(), which is potentially useful for
	validating expressions in ini/ned files.

2021-11-06  Andras Varga

	* PatternMacher: bugfix in str()

2021-11-05  Andras Varga

	* MatchExpression: fix crash on matchableObject->getAsString() returning
	nullptr.

2021-11-05  Andras Varga

	* any_ptr: let two nullptrs of different types be equal.

2021-07-20  Andras Varga

	* Expression: added dynamically resolved variables/members/funcs/methods.

2021-10-12  Andras Varga

	* OmnetppScalarFileWriter: make sure bin edges don't alias in the
	output due to unsufficient printing precision.

2021-10-06  Andras Varga

	* Create exprutil.h by factoring out functions from nedsupport.cc

2021-08-27  Andras Varga

	* MatchExpression: delete default copy/move ctor, as they are not suitable.

2021-07-29  Andras Varga

	* stringutil.h:
	- added opp_streq()
	- opp_findmatchingparen(): support more kinds of "parens"

2021-07-22  Andras Varga

	* Added omnetpp::common::any_ptr.  It is a copy of omnetpp::any_ptr from
	include/. It needs to be duplicated because <omnetpp.h> and src/common/
	cannot share code for technical reasons.

	* ExprValue: Store any_ptr instead of cObject, and follow through
	with changes: type OBJECT renamed to POINTER, objectValue() renamed
	to pointerValue(), etc.

2021-06-29  Rudolf Hornig

	* Added missing COMMON_API

2021-06-28  Andras Varga

	* opp_typename(): support nullptr_t ("Dn")

2021-06-18  Zoltan Bojthe

	* stlutil.h: Added missing template parameters

2021-06-20  Andras Varga

	* Added opp_insidemain() and opp_exiting(), needed by StringPool.

2021-06-15  Andras Varga

	* ExprValue: use opp_staticpooledstring for unit strings

2021-06-12  Andras Varga

	* StringPool -> StaticStringPool
	* Added StringPool (refcounted)
	* Added opp_pooledstring, opp_staticpooledstring

2021-06-10  Andras Varga

	* Expression: more precise error message when a function or method
	cannot be translated

2021-06-09  Andras Varga

2021-06-09  Andras Varga

	* exprnodes.h: factor out CompareNode::compare()

2021-06-07  Attila Torok

	* BigDecimal::parse(): fix bug in parsing of "inf"

2021-06-04  Attila Torok

	* Update the bundled sqlite3 amalgamation sources.

2021-05-26  Andras Varga

	* stringutil.h: added opp_indexedname()

2021-06-02  Andras Varga

	* Added AstNode::unparse()

2021-06-01  Andras Varga

	* ExprNode: added asPrinted() utility function; AstNode::str() fix

2021-05-25  Andras Varga

	* ExprNode: on errors, always prepend message with the name of the
	node.

	Added str() which is a description of the node, primarily for error
	messages. E.g. for operators, str() returns "operator '<name>'", and
	functions, "<name>()".

	If prepending with str() is not needed, override makeErrorMessage().

2021-05-11  Andras Varga

	* AstNode::str(): format change in the output.

2021-05-17  Andras Varga

	* stringutil.h: various changes for a cleaner API:

	- opp_split_and_trim() -> opp_splitandtrim() (for consistency
	  with the rest of the public stringutil.h methods)
	- opp_split: disallow empty separator
	- opp_join(): added skipEmpty flag
	- opp_format() -> opp_formati64()
	- opp_strupr() / opp_strlwr() removed
	- opp_removestart()/opp_removeend(): use std::string
	- eliminate opp_concat() (uses static buffer)
	- opp_findmatchingquote(): removed, it was duplicate
	- added opp_strndup()

2021-05-13  Andras Varga

	* Cosmetics on '// namespace' comments

2021-05-05  Andras Varga

	* StringTokenizer rewritten to support honoring quotes/parens,
	trimming, and skipping of empty tokens.

	Essentially, StringTokenizer2's functionality was merged into
	StringTokenizer.

	Incompatible change:

	When using non-whitespace separator (e.g. comman), StringTokenizer now
	TRIMS the items, while the old one did not. This can be turned off with
	the NO_TRIM option.

	Change of functionality from StringTokenizer2:

	The possibility to escape paren and quote characters outside string
	constants using backslash, i.e. the use of \(, \), etc was dropped.

	Rationale:

	1. That would have required copying the token's chars (as opposed to
	   modifying in-place by overwriting separators with NULs), and pose
	   additional complexity.

	2. Such escaping functionality is NOT supported by either NED/MSG
	   @properties, or the C preprocessor (i.e. you can't pass a value
	   that contains unbalanced parens into a macro, \( or \) results
	   in parse errors in the macro call), so perhaps the ini ${} syntax
	   can do without it too (that's the only place where this feature was
	   used).

	Details:
	- StringTokenizer's existing functionality remained unchanged
	- StringTokenizer2 is now redundant, removed

2021-05-11  Andras Varga

	* More consistent naming for stringutil.h functions

2021-05-11  Andras Varga

	* stringutil.h: add new string splitter methods, and use them instead of
	StringTokenizer(...).asVector()

2021-05-03  Andras Varga

	* concatDirAndFile(): Return path unchanged if baseDir=""

2021-05-04  Andras Varga

	* expression.y: eliminate shift/reduce conflicts

2021-05-04  Andras Varga

	* expression.y: JSON: accept extra comma at the end of lists

2020-01-13  Andras Varga

	* expression.y: JSON: accept bare numbers, true/false/nan/inf/null as map keys.

2021-04-29  Andras Varga

	* More modernizing (NULL->nullptr, use auto for iterator)

2021-04-23  Attila Torok

	include,common: Turn some macros into proper variadic ones
	(Enter_Method[_Silent], TRACE_CALL, and TPRINTF)

2021-04-16  Attila Torok

	* Fix printf format string bugs, add format(printf) attributes

2021-04-16  Andras Varga

	* UnitConversion: getBestUnit(): explicitly list "best" unit
	candidates for each unit.

2021-04-15  Andras Varga

	* UnitConversion: added getBestUnit()

2021-04-15  Andras Varga

	* UnitConversion: cache baseUnitDesc for each unit, to reduce number of lookups.

2021-04-15  Andras Varga

	* UnitConversion: added micrometer and nanometer as units

2021-04-15  Andras Varga

	*  checked_int_cast(double): resolve compile-time warning.
	Also, the refactored code better expresses the function's intention. Note
	that casting double to int *truncates* (rounds towards zero).

2021-04-14  Andras Varga

	* Fix recently introduced bug in cStringPool and StringPool; plus test

2021-04-09  Andras Varga

	* StringPool: change from std::set to std::unordered_set for performance.

2021-03-30  Rudolf Hornig

	* Add destructor to opp_runtime_error to fix build error on macOS.

2021-03-25  Levente Meszaros

	* Added JavaMatchableObject that makes match expressions accessible from Java.

2021-02-05  Levente Meszaros

	* Added optional file locking to FileReader and implemented
	explicit file change synhronization mechanism.

2021-03-20  Andras Varga

	* FileReader change: make it nicer (without macro, w/o hardcoding
	static buffer)

2021-02-05  Levente Meszaros

	* Added FileReader methods to support Java usage.
	These methods must be able to return a Java null and a properly
	terminated string.

2021-02-05  Levente Meszaros

	* Added a tokensVector() method to LineTokenizer for easier use
	from Java (SWIG).

2020-12-10  Levente Meszaros

	* Added a generic platform independent FileLock class.

2021-02-17  Andras Varga

	* UnitConversion: Enforce decreasing order of magnitude in compound
	quantities to make the syntax less error-prone. E.g. "1s 2s 3s"
	used to parse as 6s, now it is a syntax error.

2021-03-05  Andras Varga

	* Expressions: Factor out ArrayNode/ObjectNode abstract ExprNode classes

2021-03-04  Andras Varga

	* Expression: nits

2020-12-02  Andras Varga

	* sqliteresultfileschema.h: modernize: Use raw string constant.

2020-11-12  Andras Varga

	* Expression: added lambda-based ExprNode classes.

2020-11-13  Attila Torok

	* Modernizing: Use in-class member initializers wherever possible;
	use "=default" syntax for copy constructors where appropriate.
	Tool: clang-tidy plus manual editing where needed.

2020-10-14  Rudolf Hornig

	* matchexpression.y: Fix for Bison 3

2020-09-17  Attila Torok

	* Added a modified sgr_macro.h, originally by YOSHIOKA Takuma,
	from https://github.com/lo48576/sgr_macro

2020-04-30  Andras Varga

	* BigDecimal: Eliminated "BigDecimal: Cannot convert Nil to double" error.

2020-04-22  Andras Varga

	* stlutil.h: Added hash_combine and pair_hash

2020-04-16  Andras Varga

	* MatchExpressionLexer: Fix: Match expressions containing empty strings
	did not work. Example: runattr:measurement =~ ""

2020-03-05  Andras Varga

	* fileutil.h: Added collectMatchingFiles(), a function that can glob "**"
	wildcards.

2020-03-06  Andras Varga

	* fileutil.h: Added isAbsolutePath(); fix in PushDir error message.

2019-11-26  Andras Varga

	* opp_latexQuote(): Fix quoting bug.

2019-11-23  Andras Varga

	* opp_indentlines(): Nothing to do if indent is empty.

2019-11-12  Andras Varga

	* Expression: Refine grammar: Allow '::' in object's type name in JSON
	notation, to allow specifying namespace.

2019-11-07  Attila Torok

	* stlutil.h: Add contains() for unordered_set.

2019-11-07  Andras Varga

	* Matchexpression: Remove implicit OR and funcall-style field matcher
	syntaxes. They look confusing, and made it different to tell apart concise
	notation from expression-style notation.

2019-11-08  Andras Varga

	* Expression: Accept string constants with apostrophes too (makes it
	possible to write quotation marks in strings without escaping with
	backslash).

2019-11-07  Andras Varga

	* Expression: Accept JSON syntax: "null" in addition to "nullptr",
	object keys with quotes.

2019-10-28  Andras Varga

	* Expression: Grammar extended to accept JSON-line expressions. Added
	support for JSON object and array notation, and the nullptr keyword.

	Array syntax: [ expr, expr, ... ]
	Object syntax: optional_name { key1: value1, key2: value2, ... }

2019-11-07  Andras Varga

	* opp_typename(): Performance optimization (became about 2x faster).

	- Eliminate the implicit conversion of the mangledName ptr to std::string
	  before each lookup.
	- Use hash table instead of tree-based map (may be faster).

2019-11-07  Andras Varga

	* opp_typename() moved to here from src/sim. Motivation: we need it e.g. in
	Expression too.

2019-11-05  Attila Torok

	* MatchExpression: Update flags only after the pattern was parsed
	successfully. Leave them alone if an exception was thrown by parser or
	generator.

2019-10-28  Attila Torok

	* Update the bundled SQLite sources to version 3.30.1 (2019-10-10).

2019-10-29  Attila Torok

	* MatchExpression: Allow empty string as match-nothing expr.

2019-10-24  Andras Varga

	* Expression: Change the parser to accept arbitrary number of args.
	(We need to use Bison's "semantic data types", %union for that.)

2019-09-05  Attila Torok

	* OmnetppScalarFileWriter/OmnetppVectorFileWriter: quote all strings
	written as needed.

2019-07-29  Attila Torok

	* Expression: Updated lexer to accept ":" in the middle of identifiers.
	Example: attr:unit or packetDrop:count in result filters.

2019-08-26  Attila Torok

	* stlutil.h: Added small optimization to remove(vector, value).
	It seemed to help a lot in a Wireless INET simulation, in
	qtenv::Inspector::removeFromToHistory().

2019-08-01  Andras Varga

	* intutil.h: intpar_t renamed to intval_t. intval_t is the type we use for
	generic "large" integers, e.g. in the Expression class and in module
	parameters. It is currently a signed 64-bit type.

2019-07-30  Andras Varga

	* Result files: Result file version number bumped from 2 to 3, due to recent
	file format changes.

2017-07-16  Andras Varga

	* Histogram class: store binEdges, binValues plus underflow/overflow instead
	of bins. The new representation is more correct (underflow/overflow are not
	really bins because they are infinite width), and also more inline with
	Python's histogram representation.

	Result file formats are currently unaffected (still "bin" lines, with the
	first/last bin storing the underflows/overflows.)

2019-07-18  Andras Varga

	* Result files: Save the attributes of parameters (such as @unit) as well.

	Native vector/scalar files: "par" lines may be followed by "attr" lines.

	SQLite result files: Added a new table named "paramAttr", with the columns
	"paramId", "attrName" and "attrValue".

2018-07-09  Andras Varga

	* Result files: Allow recording actual values of module/channel parameters.
	This implies a slight file format change for the native (textual) result
	files, and schema change for the SQLite result files.

	Native vector/scalar files: Values are written into lines of the format
	"par <componentfullpath> <parametername> <value>".

	SQLite result files: Added a new table named "parameter", with the
	columns "paramId", "runId", "moduleName", "paramName" and "paramValue".

	Note that the value is written in the syntax it would have to be written in
	a NED file or in omnetpp.ini. That is, string constants include the
	quotation marks, and the value of volatile expressions is the expression
	itself, i.e. the value normal(0,1) of a volatile parameter will be recorded
	as such (and not the value from its random evaluation).

	Also note that the native file format uses optional quoting (strings are
	only quoted if necessary), which means that string constants need be written
	out with *double* quoting, i.e. the value 'hello' will appear in the file as
	"\"hello\"". This is necessary because due to optional quoting, the parser
	drops the first layer of quotation marks.

2018-07-09  Andras Varga

	* Result files: Save the full (flattened) contents of the inifile
	configuration, not only parameter assignment entries as before.
	This comes with a slight file format change for the native
	(textual) result files, and schema change for the SQLite result files.

	Native vector/scalar files: Configuration entries are written into
	lines of the format "config <key> <value>". The old "param" lines
	of similar syntax are no longer written, but still understood by
	the readers.

	SQLite result files: The "runParam" table was renamed to "runConfig",
	and its columns were also similarly renamed: "paramKey", "paramValue"
	and "paramOrder" became "configKey", "configValue" and "configOrder".
	Files in the old format are not understood.

2019-07-08  Andras Varga

	* exprnodes.h: added VariableNode, IndexedVariableNode, MemberNode,
	IndexedMemberNode, MethodNode; changed FunctionNode

2019-04-29  Andras Varga

	* Moved XML parser here from nedxml. In an effort to reduce OMNeT++'s
	dependencies from external libraries, we added Yxml, Yoran Heling's small
	and fast SAX-style XML parser (https://dev.yorhel.nl/yxml) with a liberal
	license, to the codebase. At the same time, we removed Expat support.
	LibXML2 support remained, but very few users will actually need it.

	Also some refactoring/cleanup:
	- use subclassing instead of #ifdefs to support multiple parsers
	- use exceptions to report parse error instead of error code + getErrorMessage()
	- removed some methods from SaxHandler (comments, CDATA start/end)
	- removed undocumented xinclude support

	Use of LibXML2 is optional. Note that no significant functionality is lost
	when LibXML2 support is turned off. XML module parameters as well as NED and
	MSG AST XML export/import are handled by Yxml just fine. LibXML2 is only
	required when DTD-based validation (and possibly, default value completion)
	or Schema-based validation is needed. Also note that Yxml-based parsing
	scales much better (OMNeT++ uses the DOM API of LibXML, which has much
	higher memory requirements than a SAX parser).

2019-05-02  Andras Varga

	* StringPool: added contains(); cosmetic change (store const char*
	instead of char*).

2019-04-30  Andras Varga

	* opp_xmlQuote() fix: ampersand must be quoted too.

2019-04-16  Andras Varga

	* Move unit conversion functions from NED to common::Expression.

2019-04-11  Andras Varga

	*  Expression: '%' to allow quantities as args.

2019-04-11  Andras Varga

	* Expression: '%' op to mandate integer args (backward INCOMPATIBLE change)

2019-04-14  Andras Varga

	* Expression: fix for the '<=>' and '=~' operators.

2019-03-12  Andras Varga

	* MatchExpression changed to use Expression internally.
	Main advantage: shortcutting boolean operators (AND, OR).

2019-02-28  Andras Varga

	* ADDED GENERIC EXPRESSION EVALUATOR CLASS.

	This is kind of a big deal. The Expression class is a from-scratch rewrite
	of the old Expression class, with the intent of creating generic extensible
	expression evaluator that can be used *everywhere*. Everywhere means: NED
	expressions, object matching, scenario constraint, statistics recording,
	result selection in scavetool/IDE, etc. The new class is tree-based instead
	of stack-based, because with stack machines one cannot (easily) do
	shotcutting evaluation of logical operators (AND,OR).

	About the Expression class:
	- Representation is an expression tree (ExprNode*), which can be extended
	  with new node types as needed.
	- Parser understands a generic expression syntax; interpretation (mapping
	  to expression tree) is done by AST translators that the user can
	  contribute/extend/replace.
	- ExprValue is pretty much a copy of cNedValue, minus XML, plus cObject*.
	- Code in operator nodes was derived from cDynamicExpression --
	  computations should behave exactly as in existing NED expressions
	  (which are cDynamicExpression-based).
	- ExprNodeFactory utility class exists.
	- The 'undefined' value (type=UNDEF) behaves a bit like NaN, anything
	  involving 'undefined' will evaluate to 'undefined'.
	- Logical operators (AND,OR) and inline-if (?:) perform shortcut.
	- Supports constant folding.

	Other:
	- intutil.h was factored out from random functions throughout

	Reuse existing parsers instead of writing a shiny new one; however,
	reverse-Polish based intermediate representation was converted to a
	simple AST representation (Expression::AstNode).

	AST tree (AstNode*) is translated into expression tree (ExprNode*) using
	translators (AstTranslator). Main method translateToExpressionTree()
	allows full freedom in translating the tree (context-sensitive, and not
	constrained one-to-one mapping). For basic needs, subclass
	BasicAstTranslator.

	More syntax accepted:
	- match operator (str =~ "**.module")
	- thre-way comparson, a.k.a. spaceship operator (<=>)
	- ident[idx], ident.ident, ident.method(...)
	- nan,inf,undefined
	- bang operator (!) syntax, currently unused

	NOTE: The fact that logical operators and inline-if are now shortcutting may
	change the fingerprint of some simulations, due to consuming fewer random
	numbers during expression evaluation.

2019-04-11  Andras Varga

	* opp_runtime_error: Added std::string constructor; removed unnecessary
	destructor.

2019-04-04  Rudolf Hornig

	* Makefile improvements.

2019-04-09  Andras Varga

	* UnitConversion: lookupUnit() sped up by using hash table.

2019-04-08  Andras Varga

	* UnitConversion: added Ws, Wh, kWh, MWh.

2019-04-02  Andras Varga

	* opp_join(): Skip empty items.

2019-04-01  Andras Varga

	* UnitConversion: Clarification in method comments.

2019-04-01  Andras Varga

	* UnitConversion: Only accept minus sign at the front, to reduce
	chance of misunderstanding in arithmetic expressions. I.e. "-5s100ms"
	is valid as a quantity string (means -5.1s), but "5s-100ms" is no longer.

2019-03-21  Andras Varga

	* stringutil.h: opp_concat(): throw error on overflowing static buffer.

2019-03-21  Andras Varga

	* stringutil.h: Added opp_removestart().

2019-03-18  Andras Varga

	* stringutil.h: Added opp_join() for two std::strings.

2019-03-03  Andras Varga

	* PatternMatcher: added str().

2019-03-03  Andras Varga

	* PatternMatcher: Added a bunch of const qualifiers to method signatures.

2019-02-21  Attila Torok

	* LineTokenizer: Reallocates its internal buffer for longer lines. (Before
	it threw an error if fixed-size buffer was overflown.)

2019-02-26  Andras Varga

	* fileutil.h: Added collectFiles().

2019-02-22  Andras Varga

	* fileutil.h: Added filenameOf() and removeFileExtension().

2019-02-21  Andras Varga

	* stringutil.h: Added opp_garble().

2017-04-24  Andras Varga

	* MatchExpression: Added 'field=~pattern' syntax as alternative to
	'field(pattern)'.

2019-01-10  Rudolf Hornig

	* Makefile: Added support to build on Windows using MS ABI compatibility
	(i.e Visual C++ libraries).

2018-03-21  Andras Varga

	* UnitConversion: no longer accept 0 without measurement unit.

	Reason: It is confusing when the unit is dB or dBm. E.g. in
	omnetpp.ini, should "**.power = 0" mean 0W or 0dBm?

2017-04-26  Andras Varga

	* stringutil.h: added opp_formatdouble()

2020-01-06  ------ omnetpp-5.6 released ------

2019-11-07  Attila Torok

	* stlutil.h: Add contains() for unordered_set.

2019-08-26  Attila Torok

	* stlutil.h: Added small optimization to remove(vector, value).
	It seemed to help a lot in a Wireless INET simulation, in
	qtenv::Inspector::removeFromToHistory().

2019-05-15  ------ omnetpp-5.5 released ------

2019-04-25  Andras Varga

	* StringPool: added contains()

2019-04-30  Andras Varga

2019-02-21  Attila Torok

	* LineTokenizer now reallocates its internal buffer for longer lines.

2019-03-08  Andras Varga

	* SQLite scheme: fix inet-#417: remove NOT NULL from vector values

2019-01-29  Andras Varga

	* SqliteVectorFileWriter:fix occasional "db==nullptr" error
	It happens when Envir calls flush() when the file was not yet opened

2018-12-17  Andras Varga

	* OmnetppVectorFileWriter: fix VectorData leak

2018-06-25  ------ omnetpp-5.4.1 released ------

	* stringutil.h/cc: added opp_strtoll(), opp_atoll(), opp_strtoull(),
	opp_atoull()

2017-12-08  ------ omnetpp-5.2.1 released ------

2017-11-10  Andras Varga

	* expression.h/cc: fixed leak in Expression::Elem::operator()= functions

2017-09-18  ------ omnetpp-5.2 released ------

2017-08-22  Andras Varga

	* unitconversion.cc: reordering (for consistency w/ manual)

2017-04-06  Andras Varga

	* Modernizing: use C++11's range-based for loops where applicable, using
	clang-tidy's modernize-loop-convert.

	not open

2017-04-06  Andras Varga

	* Refined CsvWriter and JsonWriter classes, used for exporting results
	in respective formats from scavetool and the IDE.

2017-04-04  Andras Varga

	* New result file writers: save iteration variables separately from
	run attributes. NOTE: This changes result file format!

	- omnetpp recorders: introduced "itervar" lines
	- SQLite recorder: added runItervar table

2017-03-31  Andras Varga

	entries contain a copy of the parameter assignment lines from omnetpp.ini,
	so their order is important.

	- omnetpp recorders: ensure order of "param" lines in the file mirror the
	  order in the ini file
	- SQLite recorder: added a paramOrder column to the RunParam table.

2017-03-30  Andras Varga

	* SQLite result files: histBin table renamed to histogramBin

2017-04-04  Andras Varga

	* stringutils: opp_formatTable() fix: it printed one more LF than needed

2017-03-16  Andras Varga

	* Added result file writer classes:
	OmnetppScalarFileWriter, OmnetppVectorFileWriter,
	SqliteScalarFileWriter, SqliteVectorFileWriter.

	Factored out from envir's result file manager classes.

	This is needed so that the sim kernel, scavetool and the IDE can
	share the same code for writing result files.

2017-03-04  Andras Varga

	* Added the Statistics and Histogram classes, factored out from the
	scave library. Needed by the result file writers, see next change.

2017-03-07  Andras Varga

	   - fix: expand to ((void)0) in release mode
	   - error message edited for clarity

2017-02-18  Andras Varga

	* Added FormattedPrinter class (useful for printing help in command-line
	programs)

2017-02-21  Andras Varga

	* stringutil.h: Added opp_split(), opp_formatTable()

2017-02-17  Andras Varga

2016-10-30  Andras Varga

	* Adjustments on error messages

2016-10-27  Andras Varga

	* stringutil.h: more const std::string& arguments instead of const char *.

	We don't like mixing const char * and std::string in method signatures,
	as it results in too many .c_str() at call sites, and in some cases
	prevents optimizing std::string assignments (e.g. refcounting+COW).

2016-10-21  Andras Varga

	* EnumStringIterator (used for resolving run number lists): fix: properly
	skip empty ranges, tolerate spaces. It used to return the start of the
	range, e.g. 5..1 expanded to 5.

2016-10-20  Andras Varga

	* expression.y: accept '=' as alternative to '=='

2016-09-30  Levente Meszaros

	* unitconversion.cc: Added coulomb [C] and related units As, mAs, Ah, mAh.

2016-09-25  Andras Varga

	* Added stlutil.h

2016-09-25  Andras Varga

	* matchexpression.h: added MatchableStringMap

	* stringutil.h: opp_indentlines() fix: do not add indent after last line

2016-09-25  Andras Varga

	* stringutil.h: added opp_sanitizeFileName() and opp_filenameencode()

2016-11-30  Rudolf Hornig

	* The updated build system now uses the ./configure file only to detect
	certain flags and libraries. Most of the build logic is handled by the
	Makefile.inc file itslef. This allows you to enable/disable optional
	components (i.e. Tkenv,Qtenv,OSG and osgEarth support) without even
	re-running the ./configure file.

2016-08-23  Andras Varga

	* stringutil.h: added opp_xmlQuote()

2016-08-22  Andras Varga

	* opp_vsscanf(): %g to mean float not double, for consistency with scanf()

2016-07-15  Andras Varga

	* Expression: evaluator methods made const

2016-07-11  Andras Varga

	* Expression: parser: allow variables with a syntax of module paths,
	i.e. dot-separated sequence of name or name[index] segments.

2016-07-07  Mihaly Palenik

	* stringutil.h: added opp_format() for formatting integers with digit
	groups.

2016-06-23  Rudolf Hornig

	* The makefile now uses compiler-generated dependency files.

2016-01-18  Andras Varga

	* Added opp_substringbeforelast() and opp_substringafterlast().

2015-12-07  ------ omnetpp-5.0b3 released ------

2015-11-17  Andras Varga

	* UnitConversion: added femtosecond and attosecond, as they are needed
	for the new simtime-resolution config option.

2015-10-16  Andras Varga

	* omnetpp namespace made permanent (cannot be turned off):
	- removed configure option and preprocessor symbol USE_NAMESPACE
	- removed related macros: NAMESPACE_BEGIN, NAMESPACE_END,
	  USING_NAMESPACE, OPP, OPP_STR, OPP_PREFIX etc.

2015-08-10  Attila Torok

	Added the colorutil files with SVG color names, currently used by
	cCanvas and Qtenv.

2015-07-20  ------ omnetpp-5.0b2 released ------

2015-06-30  Andras Varga

	* opp_strnistr() fix (did not match at the end of the string)

2015-06-19  Andras Varga

	* expression.lex: fix #830 "kernel crashes when adding '//' to parameter
	lines in ini-files". The expression parser was not supposed to support
	"//" comments in the first place

2015-06-11  Andras Varga

	* UnitConversion: put back kB/MB/GB/TB with the correct (base 10) meaning.
	Note: base 2 units also exist: KiB, MiB, GiB, TiB.

2015-06-08  Andras Varga

	* Cleanup: longer header guards

2015-06-08  Andras Varga

	* Cleanup: code formatting

2015-05-15  Andras Varga

	* CommonStringPool renamed to StringPool (due to namespaces, it no longer
	conflicts with StringPools in other source folders)

2015-05-15  Andras Varga

	* Cleanup: use per-folder nested namespaces: omnetpp::envir, omnetpp::tkenv,
	omnetpp::layout, omnetpp::common, omnetpp::eventlog, etc.

2015-05-22  Andras Varga

	* Modernizing: added the 'override' keyword (C++11) to overridden methods;
	it becomes blank when using with an older compiler.

2015-05-21  Rudolf Hornig

	* Modernizing: replaced NULLs by 'nullptr' (C++11); it is defined as 0
	when using an older compiler.

2015-04-20  Andras Varga

	* Cleanup: use C++ names of C headers (e.g. <cstdio> instead of <stdio.h>)

2015-04-12  Andras Varga

	* Cleanup: copyright years updated

2015-04-08  Andras Varga

	* Modernizing:

	- Use a fixed include path (-Iinclude -Isrc) for all source folders
	  under src/, and qualify cross-folder #includes with the folder
	  name (e.g. change #include "stringutil.h" to #include "common/stringutil.h").
	  This increases readbility and reduces the chance of including a wrong
	  header.

	- In source files, sort #include statements by folder.

2015-03-04  ------ omnetpp-5.0b1 released ------

2015-02-07  Andras Varga

	During development in the 5.0 branch (2013-2014):

	* stringutil.cc/h: new utility functions: opp_strnistr(), opp_urldecode(),
	opp_makedatetimestring(), opp_join()

	* TRACE macro renamed to TRACE_CALL due to conflict with new module logging API

2014-11-27  ------ omnetpp-4.6 released ------

2013-01-09  Andras Varga

	* Renamed methods of cMatchExpression::Matchable:
	    getDefaultAttribute() -> getAsString()
	    getAttribute(const char *name) -> getAsString(const char *attribute)

2012-10-03  Andras Varga

	* fix in Expression: '-2m' was evaluated to '2' (meter was lost)

2012-01-14  Andras Varga

	* MatchExpression: OR operator made optional.
	E.g. now "Host" or "Router" or "Switch" can be written as "Host Router Switch",
	which is more natural at places (code that so far took a space-separated
	list of possible items, like node selectors in INET's configurator,
	can now be naturally extended to have more power by using
	MatchExpression, without affecting existing users or making OR mandatory).

	* unitconversion.cc: addressed bug #369:
	- added "mps" (m/s) and "kmph" (km/h) as recognized units.
	- several units have been renamed to be more standards compliant:
	  Kbps -> kbps, KB -> KiB, MB -> MiB, GB -> GiB, TB -> TiB;
	- added explanations to "Cannot convert" error messages about the
	renamed units

2011-05-06  Andras Varga

	* fileutil.cc: fix bug #284: isDirectory() should not throw exception
	if file or directory does not exist

2008-12-12  ------ omnetpp-4.0rc1 released ------

2008-11-26  Andras Varga

	* library renamed to oppcommon ("common" was too common)

2008-02-23  Andras Varga

	* Started the ChangeLog. The Common library was added in omnetpp-4.0,
	and it contains classes and functions used by all parts of OMNeT++.
