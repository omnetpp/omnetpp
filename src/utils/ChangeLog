	* build: Disable implicit make rules by setting .SUFFIXES to empty

2022-04-11  ------ omnetpp-6.0 released ------

2022-01-06  Rudolf Hornig

	* Added a new command named `opp_ide` to start the IDE. omnetpp and
	omnest are aliases to this.

2021-12-15  Andras Varga

	* opp_charttool: Added "templates" command.

2021-11-26  Rudolf Hornig

	* opp_test: Test case outcomes are now one of PASS, FAIL, ERROR, SKIP and
	EXPECTEDFAIL.

2021-11-17  Andras Varga

	* opp_charttool: improved filtering (-i, -n options) to allow multiple
	charts to be selected:

	- changed -i option to accept index lists and ranges too
	- changed -n from exact match to substring match

2021-10-29  Rudolf Hornig

	* Several small fixes for Windows to be able to start the IDE using shortcuts.

2021-10-08  Rudolf Hornig

	* opp_makemake: Do not generate generate .def files on MS-ABI builds, as .def
	file generation is not supported by Microsoft's LINK.EXE.

2021-06-10  Rudolf Hornig

	* opp_configfilepath now returns absolute canonized file path to Makefile.inc
	This makes it easier to identify which Makefile.inc is actually in use.

2021-06-09  Rudolf Hornig

	* Removed unused files:
	- removed .cmd files as they are no longer used even on Windows
	- opp_onfigfilepath is generated directly in the bin dir
	- fixed missing files in the clean target

2021-06-01  Rudolf Hornig

	* build: no longer use the OMNETPP_ROOT *environment* variable in Makefiles

2021-05-30  Andras Varga

	* opp_test: on error, print the command used to start the simulation.

2021-04-20  Andras Varga

	opp_makemake: only overwrite Makefile if it has different contents
	(preserve old timestamp if there is no change).

2021-03-19  Andras Varga

	* opp_makemake: Raise limit on maximum number of directories to traverse
	for --deep.

2021-03-03  Andras Varga

	* opp_test: Suggest 'meld' command to compare output with test file too.

2021-03-03  Andras Varga

	* opp_test: Fix recently introduced bug.

2021-02-28  Andras Varga

	* opp_charttool: Fix "'error_list' is not defined" error.

2021-02-24  Andras Varga

	* opp_test, opp_fingerprinttest: refactor colorizing support.
	Not yet used in opp_fingerprinttest, but it would probably be useful.

2021-02-23  Andras Varga

	* opp_charttool fixes:
	- try-catch for the export cases as well
	- print failure summary at the end
	- description edited
	- nits

2021-02-23  Attila Torok

	* opp_charttool: Add --no-show switch to the run command,
	improved argument list processing.

	of libcharttool).

2021-01-11  Attila Torok

	* opp_charttool: Catch exceptions from chart scripts in opp_charttool

2021-01-11  Attila Torok

	* opp_charttool: Split the insides of opp_charttool into libcharttool,
	a reusable module

2020-12-17  Rudolf Hornig

	* opp_makemake: delete temp file on shared library build even if the
	linker command fails

2020-12-02  Rudolf Hornig

	* Generate import lib and def files on Windows, speed up linking

	- speedup on INET linking 90s -> 5s

	- def and import lib files are generated alomng with the DLL by
	  specifying extra command line options for the linker (instead of
	  a two step process)

	- the LLD linker generates incorrect import libs so we have to
	  manually fix them with the 'llvm-ar d' command by removing the first
	  file in the generated import lib archive. When using the system linker
	  this command does not do anything (NOP).

	- speed up linking: instead of first generating a static lib and then
	  using that during the linking, we can pass all object files at once
	  using the @filelist syntax. This prevents 'command too long' errors
	  and is now supported with both clang and gcc.

	- as we no longer use --enable-auto-import, we must use proper XXX_API
	  macros with both MinGW and MS ABI based builds. Until now, only
	  MS ABI based builds were using those macros.

2020-10-05  Attila Torok

	* opp_charttool: support folders as "inputs" in ANF files.

2020-10-31  Attila Torok

	* opp_featuretool: Fix in help text: ".oppfeaturestatus" -> ".oppfeaturestate"

2020-11-05  Rudolf Hornig

	* opp_makemake: use Group Target in generated makefiles when creating
	a shared library.

	On Windows, we have to generate both a .dll and an export lib (.dll.a)
	when creating a shared lib. These two files are created by the linker at
	the same time, so we have to specify that they are not separate
	dependencies, but they are generated by the same recipe, otherwise the
	linker would be started two times when using parallel build.

	Sadly the &: syntax is supported only on gnu make 4.3+, but luckily we
	bundle that version on Windows (where we need it). On macOS and Linux
	(where only gno make 4.2.1 is available) it silently falls back to the
	original : behavior (i.e. simple dependency). But on these platform we
	have only a single target anyway (no importlib is generated) so it does
	not matter.

	NOTE: this might still cause the above issue if cross compilation to
	Windows is used on a Linux host, while the installed make is still 4.2 or
	lower. It's not a critical bug, it just makes the build process longer by
	unnecessarily running the linker twice.

2020-09-24  Rudolf Hornig

	* opp_makemake : do not use --rpath on Windows at all, as it is meaningless
	and LLD does not support it.

2020-08-31  Rudolf Hornig

	* Makefile: Do not generate a ".wishname" file

2020-05-04  Attila Torok

	* opp_charttool: Print a more detailed description in its help.

2020-01-02  Attila Torok

	* opp_charttool: small fixes

2019-12-10  Zoltan Bojthe

	* opp_test: performance: Use rstrip() instead of regexp which was
	taking a long time for large output files.

2019-12-05  Zoltan Bojthe

	* opp_test: colorization: Print PASS/FAIL/UNRESOLVED text in color.

2019-12-06  Andras Varga

	* opp_featuretool: Extensive refactoring as well as refinement of its
	operation and command-line options.

	In general, the tool has become more forgiving: a missing ".featurestates"
	file and extra/missing entries in it don't cause an error or even a
	message. Missing file and file entries are initialized with the default
	enablement state; extra entries are preserved (in the hope they'll be
	useful, e.g. after switching to a different topic branch. The content
	of the ".nedexclusions" file is now also automatically adjusted without
	stopping with an error.

	User-visible changes are the following:
	- Removed the "validate" and "repair" commands (all commands implicitly
	  validate and repair now).
	- Better validation of the ".oppfeatures" file: Report detect duplicate
	  feature IDs and unresolved feature dependencies.
	- Check for the existence of the C++ source root and NED folders.
	- Preserve unknown features in the ".featurestate" file instead of fail/warn
	  about them. Reason: they often occur when switching between branches.
	- "isenabled -v" prints list of disabled features to stdout, not to stderr
	- Complain less about fixable problems.
	- Non-verbose operation by default.
	- Improved error/warning messages.

2019-10-30  Rudolf Hornig

	* Use python3 in all scripts.

2019-08-28  Attila Torok

	* opp_charttool: Porting to the new chart/results API, improvements.

2019-04-11  Rudolf Hornig

	* opp_makemake: The "cleanall" target now properly cleans all MODEs
	defined in Makefile.inc.in.

2019-04-11  Rudolf Hornig

	* opp_makemake: The "makefrag" file is now included instead of copied
	into the generated makefile.

2019-04-04  Rudolf Hornig

	* opp_makemake: Added a "help" target to the generated makefiles.
	Typing "make help" now prints the list of accepted targets ("all",
	"clean", etc.) and user-settable makefile variables ("MODE", "V",
	"CFLAGS", etc.), complete with helpful descriptions and usage
	examples.

2019-04-04  Rudolf Hornig

	* Makefile improvements.

2019-02-28  Rudolf Hornig

	* Added opp_neddoc, a tool that makes it possible to generate HTML
	documentation from NED files from the command line. opp_neddoc works by
	launching the IDE in headless mode.

2018-11-27  Andras Varga

	* opp_test: Don't colorize if output is redirected; lift 8K limit for printing.

2018-02-02  Zoltan Bojthe

	* opp_test: Improve diagnostic output for failed tests: Show
	colorized diff instead of simply printing the expected and the actual
	content.

2018-11-21  Attila Torok

	* Added opp_charttool, a tool for "running" ANF files on the command line
	for their side effects, i.e. automated chart export.

2020-01-06  ------ omnetpp-5.6 released ------

2019-12-06  Andras Varga

	* opp_test: fixed "io.UnsupportedOperation: can't do nonzero end-relative seeks"
	error on python3.

2019-11-07  Rudolf Hornig

	* opp_featuretool: fixed unstable order of features in the output, causing
	intermittent failures in tests.

2019-05-09  Andras Varga

	* opp_test: fix: ignore exit code if test printed "#UNRESOLVED"

2019-03-27  Andras Varga

	* opp_test: fix "dictionary changed size during iteration" Python error

2019-05-15  ------ omnetpp-5.5 released ------

2019-01-24  Rudolf Hornig

	* opp_makemake: Fixed dependency file generation. The dependency file
	generated by a .msg and the related object file's dependency file were
	overwriting each other.

2018-11-23  Attila Torok

	* opp_test: Convert the simulation return code to bash/windows convention.

2018-07-06  Rudolf Hornig

	* IDE: fixed the trashy cursors during connection drag and new module
	creation with GTK3 The IDE now runs with GTK3. Both the cursor issue
	and the missing 3-state checkbox issue in the launcher dialog has been fixed.

2018-09-21  Attila Torok

	* Replace $* with "$@" in a couple of scripts.

2018-06-25  ------ omnetpp-5.4.1 released ------

2018-06-20  Zoltan Bojthe

	* Fix: Python utils: handle the exception OSError in the same way as
	IOError

2018-06-15  Attila Torok

	* opp_test: Return non-zero if there were any failed or unresolved tests.

2018-06-15  Attila Torok

	* opp_test: Return non-zero if there were any failed or unresolved tests.

2018-06-11  ------ omnetpp-5.4 released ------

2018-06-06  Attila Torok

	* opp_runall: Fix batch size calculation (float -> int). [reported by
	Florian Kauer]

	See https://groups.google.com/d/msg/omnetpp/MmgDHyU9YrQ/kXAtGY43BAAJ

	Quote:

	In opp_runall (of version 5.3) the batchSize calculation might result in
	a floating point type, e.g. if len(runNumbers) = 13 and opts.jobs = 4.
	While math.ceil rounds the result, it is still of floating point type and
	thus leads to an error when using this value in the chunks method as
	argument to range ("integer step argument expected, got float").

2018-04-11  ------ omnetpp-5.3 released ------

2018-03-07  Rudolf Hornig

	* opp_fingerprint, opp_runall: switch to Python 2, as macOS has no
	Python in its default installation

2018-03-01  Andras Varga

	* opp_fingerprinttest: fix: error messages from the simulation did
	not appear. Only "<!> Error" was printed, but not the actual error
	message.

2018-02-08  Rudolf Hornig

	* opp_test, opp_fingerprinttest: made to work on Windows

2018-01-26  Zoltan Bojthe

	* opp_test: fixed argument passing in runscript: $* replaced to "$@"

2017-12-20  Rudolf Hornig

	* opp_fingerprinttest: Added a new tool that allows running fingerprint
	tests against a model. Tests can be defined in a CSV file describing the
	working directory, command line, simulation time limit, expeted fingerprint
	hash and the expected result.

2017-12-18  Zoltan Bojthe

	* opp_test: Reimplemented in Python

2017-11-22  Rudolf Hornig

	* opp_makemake: Generate dependency files for .msg files too (when they
	use imports)

2017-01-06  Zoltan Bojthe

	* opp_featuretool: Show help when using without any arguments, or
	when there is an error in the command-line arguments

2017-11-17  Attila Torok

	* opp_featuretool: Add note about command-specific arguments to
	help.

2017-11-15  Zoltan Bojthe

	* opp_featuretool: Fixed bug in processing prerequisites

2017-12-08  ------ omnetpp-5.2.1 released ------

2017-09-18  ------ omnetpp-5.2 released ------

2017-07-06  Rudolf Hornig

	* opp_makemake: fixed build file dependency problem when the target name
	has an extension. Note the double colon (::) dependency definition in the
	generated makefiles. This is called terminal rule, and required because the
	rule applies to all files (%) in a folder. This is a special case for the
	generic % rule.

2017-05-26  Rudolf Hornig

	* opp_makemake: IMPORTANT CHANGES regarding debug/release-mode builds

	- Models are built in RELEASE mode by default. Until now, DEBUG was the
	  default, which resulted in casual users always running their simulations
	  in DEBUG mode, i.e. much slower than possible.

	- RELEASE and DEBUG mode binaries can now co-exist, so users do not have
	  to recompile when they switch modes (e.g. when they want to debug a
	  simulation -- remember, they are built in RELEASE mode by default.)
	  This is a significant gain especially for large models like INET.
	  The goal was achieved by adding the "_dbg" suffix to the names of
	  DEBUG-mode binaries.

	- Binaries are now hard-linked from the build directory (out/) to the
	  target directory instead of being soft-linked. This leaves the copy
	  in the build directory intact when the one in the target directory
	  is deleted.

2017-05-25  Rudolf Hornig

	* Updated makefiles for speeding up the build:
	- generated files are created only once, even when using parallel build
	- binaries are copied to their final destination using proper makefile
	  targets

2017-05-18  Rudolf Hornig

	* Updated makefiles to speed up the build process (eliminited superfluous
	file copying when everything was up to date.)

	* Makefiles now correctly check all dependencies and return
	immeiately if the build is up to date.

	* Generated source files are created only once when parallel
	build is used. Previously the same file was unnecessarily
	generated several times.

	* Makefiles in samples folder are re-created only if they are missing.

	* The 'samples' folder is now optional and can be deleted if it's
	not needed.

2017-05-08  ------ omnetpp-5.1.1 released ------

2017-03-31  ------ omnetpp-5.1 released ------

2017-03-24  Andras Varga

	* opp_test: write out substitution result (useful for test debugging)

2017-03-09  Rudolf Hornig

	* opp_makemake: improved the "clean" target in the generated makefiles
	(use recursive wildcard; delete only the actual target)

2017-02-16  Rudolf Hornig

	* configure: the script no longer detects and tests for the presence
	of the 'pcap' library. If models need it, they have to implement their
	own method to detect and configure it.

2017-02-06  ------ omnetpp-5.1pre3 released ------

2017-01-30  Rudolf Hornig

	* Fix: don't show warning on macOS after starting the IDE the second time

2017-01-26  Rudolf Hornig

	* opp_makemake: the IDE now generates exactly the same makefile as opp_makemake.
	This allows easier switching between IDE and command line without rebuilding
	the model

2016-12-23  ------ omnetpp-5.1pre2 released ------

2016-12-19  Rudolf Hornig

	* opp_featuretool: dump the feature macros in sorted order

2016-12-19  Andras Varga

	* opp_test: fix for "|" as %subst separator character

2016-12-19  Andras Varga

	* opp_test: fix: quoting was messed up with %extraargs that contain
	single-quoted args

2016-12-05  Rudolf Hornig

	* Removed unsused abspath.c

2016-12-02  Rudolf Hornig

	* Fixed IDE start scripts to avoid security warnings on macOS

2016-11-30  Rudolf Hornig

	* Removed several unused utilities like opp_makedep, abspath etc.

	* opp_makemake no longer supports generating nmake compatible makefiles
	(i.e. the --nmake option was removed). GNU Makefiles can be used with
	the Microsoft Clang/C2 compiler to generate Visual C++ compatible code.

	* The updated build system now uses the ./configure file only to detect
	certain flags and libraries. Most of the build logic is handled by the
	Makefile.inc file itself. This allows you to enable/disable optional
	components (i.e. Tkenv, Qtenv, OSG and osgEarth support) without even
	re-running the ./configure file.

2016-11-30  Rudolf Hornig

	* Removed unused utilities and updated manual

2016-11-23  Rudolf Hornig

	* Removed abspath and lcg32_seedtool binaries.

2016-08-04  Andras Varga

	* opp_test: print bigger tail on failure

2016-10-06  Andras Varga

	* opp_test: export "run" script to facilitate running tests manually

2016-09-27  Andras Varga

	* opp_runall reimplemented in Python, for the new "-q" API

2016-07-05  Andras Varga

	* opp_makemake: removed support for deep includes. The
	--no-deep-includes option (used to turn off deep includes) is
	still accepted for backward compatibility, and is a no-op.

	As it turned out, deep includes (i.e. adding every directory in the
	source tree to the include path) is not good for large projects
	(too error-prone), and not needed for small projects. It was removed
	from the IDE as well.

2016-06-23  Rudolf Hornig

	* The makefile now uses compiler-generated dependency files.

2016-06-22  Rudolf Hornig

	* opp_makemake changed to generate makefiles that use compiler-generated
	dependency files

2016-04-13  ------ omnetpp-5.0 released ------

2016-04-04  Zoltan Bojthe

	* featuretool: shows error when a NED package mentioned in a feature does
	not have a corresponding folder (may also be caused by missing .nedfolders)

2016-03-17  Zoltan Bojthe

	* opp_featuretool: nedfolders file is not required

2016-03-10  ------ omnetpp-5.0rc released ------

2016-02-29  Zoltan Bojthe & Rudolf Hornig

	* Updated opp_featuretool and related documentation. Removed unnecessary
	warning when an OMNeT++ 4.x-compatible .nedfolders file is detected. Added
	isenabled command.

2016-02-10  Zoltan Bojthe

	* opp_test: execute pre-run commands (%prerun-command) in the "run" phase
	instead of the "generate" phase.

2015-12-11  Rudolf Hornig

	* Fixed copying opp_featuretool to the bin directory.

2015-12-07  ------ omnetpp-5.0b3 released ------

2015-11-20  Zoltan Bojthe

	* opp_test: pre-run and post-run scripts (%prerun-command, %postrun-command)
	are now executed in the order they occur in the .test file

2015-07-20  ------ omnetpp-5.0b2 released ------

2015-06-08  Andras Varga

	* Cleanup: code formatting

2015-04-20  Andras Varga

	* Cleanup: use C++ names of C headers (e.g. <cstdio> instead of <stdio.h>)

2015-04-12  Andras Varga

	* Cleanup: copyright years updated

2015-03-04  ------ omnetpp-5.0b1 released ------

2015-02-15  Andras varga

	* opp_makedep: sort the dependencies (minimizes conflicts during rebase)

2013-02-27  Andras Varga

	* opp_makedep, opp_makemake: added support for state machine files,
	in preparation for a future state machine compiler in OMNeT++

2014-11-27  ------ omnetpp-4.6 released ------

2013-10-08  Andras Varga

	* opp_test: always generate and add "_defaults.ini" to the simulation
	program args. (So %inifile entries in the .test file no longer replace
	the default inifile, but rather, "_defaults.ini" serves as a fallback
	to %inifile-generated files). The practical consequence is that in
	%inifile you no longer need to repeat the entries in the default
	generated inifile. (Backported from 5.0)

	* opp_test: leave result file names at their defaults. (Backported from 5.0)

	* opp_test: added %prerun-command and %postrun-command. (Backported from 5.0)

	* opp_test: removed %module_a/%module_b support (they were too specific
	to be generally useful)

	* opp_test: changed -g/-r/-c args to run/gen/check

	* opp_test: remove trailing spaces from each line when reading the test file

2014-06-30  ------ omnetpp-4.5 released ------

	* Visual C++ makefiles are now printing only the name of the compiled
	file. Verbose mode can be turned on by specifying V=1.

2012-10-27  Rudolf Hornig

	* GNU Makefiles now print only the name of the compiled
	file, but not the whole command line. This makes the build output
	a bit less verbose. Verbose mode can be turned on by specifying V=1
	as a parameter for make.

2012-03-13  ------ omnetpp-4.2.2 released ------

2012-01-17  ------ omnetpp-4.2.1 released ------

2011-11-06  Andras Varga

	* linkall.pl: fix: /libpath was only accepted on the command line
	and not in the listfile; also, directory name with quotes caused
	error

2011-10-28  ------ omnetpp-4.2 released ------

2011-09-11  ------ omnetpp-4.2rc1 released ------

2011-05-25  Andras Varga

	* opp_msvcver.pl: fix #75: Chinese version of Visual C++ was not
	recognized, because the words "bit" and "version" have also been
	translated in the cl.exe logo output.

	* opp_makemake: in generated makefiles, ln -sf, mkdir -p and
	opp_shlib_postprocess are now referred to via Makefile.inc variables
	(LN, MKPATH, SHLIB_POSTPROCESS).

2010-05-31  ------ omnetpp-4.1rc2 released ------

2010-05-28  Levente Meszaros

	* opp_test: support multiple %inifile entries in the .test file

2010-05-09  Andras Varga

	* opp_test: do not delete "%contains" files that look like source files
	(.h,.cc,.msg,.ned) i.e. they are surely not generated by the test
	simulation.

2010-04-20  ------ omnetpp-4.1b4 released ------

2010-04-01  Andras Varga

	* opp_makemake: support long linker lines (>32K) on Windows, via using
	temp files for arguments (edit: actually it still does not work,
	because g++ internally attempts to launch its inferior processes with
	a >32K command line, and fails... There seems to be no other solution
	than splitting up the project's sources to multiple libs..

2010-03-31  Levente M�sz�ros

	* opp_test: added new entries called %file-exists and %file-not-exists
	with a single file name parameter.

2010-03-30  Andras Varga

	* opp_test: %subst to understand backrefs ($1) in the replacement string

2010-03-14  ------ omnetpp-4.1b3 released ------

2009-09-03  Andras Varga

	* opp_test: improvement: save the reference outputs (i.e. bodies of
	various %contain blocks) in work/testname  [bug 96]

2009-07-07  Andras Varga

	* added opp_pefileversion.cc, for detecting Visual C++ version in a
	NLS-independent way [code from ViRe]

2009-03-12  ------ omnetpp-4.0 released ------

2009-02-27  ------ omnetpp-4.0rc2 released ------

2009-02-20  Rudolf Hornig

	* opp_test: implemented %extraargs

2009-01-02  Andras Varga

	* added opp_runall

2008-12-12  ------ omnetpp-4.0rc1 released ------

2008-12-02  Andras Varga

	* seedtool: renamed opp_lcg32_seedtool, and added a warning in its help
	that it is an obsolete tool and probably should not be used.

2008-11-17  Andras Varga

	* opp_test: implemented %env for setting environment variables for
	the test program. Example:  %env: NEDPATH=this;that

2008-11-09  Andras Varga

	* opp_makemake: streamline the generated makefile: definitions,
	actions, etc are only generated when they are actually needed

2008-10-25  Andras Varga

	* opp_makemake: use individual targets for each sub-make directory,
	instead of iterating over $(SUBMAKE_DIRS); also removed $(SUBMAKE_DIRS)

	* opp_makemake: several refinements and bugfixes

	* opp_test improvements: -c, %testprog

2008-09-30  Andras Varga

	* opp_makemake: added $(LDFLAGS) to the command line when building
	shared libraries

2008-08-17  Andras Varga

	* opp_makemake: default target name changed to the project name, from
	the name of the makefile directory

2008-07-11  Andras Varga

	* opp_test: implemented the possibility to do replacements on the output
	before matching. This is useful for handling platform differences, like
	MSVC printing NaN and INF differently from gcc.
	    Syntax: %subst /search-regex/replacement/flags
	It is allowed to have more than one %subst in a test case file.
	Perl-style regexes are supported (of course).

2008-07-10  Andras Varga

	* opp_test: removed feature that {} was synonymous to @TESTNAME@, and
	{foo} to @TESTNAME@_foo. Those abbreviations are no longer that useful,
	now that NED files of different test cases don't interfere.

	* opp_test: new feature: any test can declare the result to be
	unresolved, by printing #UNRESOLVED or #UNRESOLVED:some-explanation
	on its standard output

2008-06-23  Rudolf Hornig, Andras Varga

	* opp_makedep: optimized by memoizing the result of header files scan

	* opp_makedep: added -v, --verbose command-line option

	* opp_makedep: fix: it choked if there was a directory with the same
	name as an included files (ie. #include <queue>, and a queue/ dir)

2008-06-15  Andras Varga

	* opp_makemake: generate one rule per .msg file. note: batch rules like
	    $(MSG_H_FILES) $(MSG_CC_FILES): $(MSGFILES)
	    	$(MSGC{nmake?:/=\}) -s _m.{cc} $(MSGCOPTS) $(MSGFILES)
	have been tries but do not work properly (nmake tends to recompile
	everything when any msg file changes)

2008-06-15  Andras Varga

	* added ln.c

2008-06-01  Andras Varga

	Summary of changes for the OMNeT++ 4.0 branch:

	* opp_test:
	 - each test gets its own directory
	 - new section %includes -- it goes outside the C++ namespace
	   (%global goes inside)  TODO add to the docu!!!
	 - new entry %network: it sets the network name in the ini file,
	   possibly in the generated ned files too

	* opp_(n)makemake: unified unix and windows versions in a new
	template substitution based implementation

	* opp_(n)makemake: dropped -N option, and made dynamic NED loading
	the default

	* opp_(n)makemake: default is linking with BOTH cmdenv and tkenv (pass
	the -u option to simulation executables to choose Cmdenv or Tkenv)

	* opp_makedep: --objdir option changed to --objprefix (also available
	as -P)

	* opp_(n)makemake option changes:
	  - renamed -b,--basedir to -P,--projectdir
	  - old -P option (opp_msgc windows export/import symbol) became -p
	  - added --nmake option
	  - added -M, --mode option
	  - the -c filename, --configfile filename option no longer exists,
	    config file is found by calling opp_configfilepath
	  - removed -t,--importlib option, as plain -l does the job as well
	  - added -a,--make-lib option, which builds a static lib
	  - removed tstamp mechanism from opp_makemake (wasn't very useful)
	  - generates dependencies for msg files too, but expects _m.cc files
	    on the command line for that!

2006-10-21  ------ omnetpp-3.3 released ------

2006-10-19  Andras Varga

	* opp_nmakemake: bugfix: running it with a -I"path with space" option,
	the quotes didn't make it into the generated Makefile.vc

2006-01-12  ------ omnetpp-3.2p1 released ------

2006-01-09  Andras Varga

	* opp_nmakemake: failed if a directory name contained "++" when the -b
	option was specified

	* opp_makedep: return exit code 0 when called without args to print help

2005-10-19  ------ omnetpp-3.2 released ------

2005-10-13  Andras Varga

	* opp_makemake, opp_nmakemake: fix: internal abs2rel routine didn't
	work for 1-char directory names

2005-09-22  Andras Varga

	* opp_neddoc.in: changed to use @@listfile syntax to invoke nedtool.

2005-08-06  Andras Varga

	* opp_nmakemake: implemented -s, -t, -d options to enable building DLLs

	* opp_makemake.in: added -t, -d options (do-nothing options) for
	command-line compatibility with opp_nmakemake

2005-08-05  Andras Varga

	* opp_makemake.in, opp_nmakemake: added -P option (just gets passed
	to opp_msgc)

2005-07-19  Andras Varga

	* opp_neddoc.in: changed runprog so that it gives system() a single
	string. This is necessary because we need to use the shell because
	of redirections. As documented at http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/
	system.html, perl uses the shell to execute a program if there is
	only one scalar parameter and this must contain a shell metacharacter.
	[reported by Johann Glaser]

	* opp_neddoc.in: changed network images (GNED diagrams) from JPG
	to PNG. (It was JPG because a browser beginning with "I" used to have
	versions around with poor to none PNG support, and GhostScript
	of course didn't create GIFs.) [change suggested by Johann Glaser]

2005-05-20  Andras Varga

	* opp_nmakemake: added printing of "entering <directory>", "leaving
	<directory>" messages

2005-03-31  ------ omnetpp-3.1 released ------

2005-03-03  Andras Varga

	* opp_makemake, opp_nmakemake: implemented -X (ignore subdirectory) option

2004-12-29  ------ omnetpp-3.0 released ------

2004-12-10  Andras Varga

	* opp_test: always used dynamic NED loading, regardless of -N option

2004-11-29  Andras Varga

  	* opp_makemake.in: avoid generating $(wildcard ..) without args.
  	Change needed for Mac OS/X [patch from Michael Tuexen]

	* opp_test: similar change as to opp_neddoc.in below, on 2004-11-21

2004-11-23  ------ omnetpp-3.0b1 released ------

2004-11-21  Andras Varga

  	* opp_neddoc.in: fixed the way it invokes commmands via system()
  	(We to break up the command line, otherwise redirection sometimes
  	breaks on Windows; plus we always need to use COMSPEC)

2004-11-03  ------ omnetpp-3.0a9 released ------

2004-11-03  Andras Varga

	* opp_test: fixed bug which caused %not-contains tests not to take
	place.

2004-10-27  Andras Varga

	* seedtool.cc: edited banner to clarify it generates seeds for LCG32.

2004-10-15  Andras Varga

	* opp_makemake.in: fixed "-L" bug introduced in 3.0a7 (2004-09-14)

2004-10-04  ------ omnetpp-3.0a8 released ------

2004-10-04  Andras Varga

	* opp_makemake.in: "tr [a-z] [A-Z]" changed to "tr '[a-z]' '[A-Z]'"
	to prevent shell expansion [patch by Kendy Kutzner]

2004-09-24  ------ omnetpp-3.0a7 released ------

2004-09-24  Andras Varga

	* opp_makemake.in, opp_nmakemake: don't delete $(TARGET) with "-n"

2004-09-14  Andras Varga

	* opp_nmakemake: added -b <basedir> option. <basedir> is supposed
	to be the toplevel directory of large multi-directory simulation model.
	The -b option will cause all path names (passed with -I, -L, etc.)
	to be converted from absolute to relative. This means that makefiles
	will not need to be re-generated or edited then the project is
	compiled in a different directory.

2004-08-12  Andras Varga

	* neddocproc.pl: backslashing can be used to prevent unintentional
	hyperlinking of a word which is also a component (e.g. module) name.
	That is, \IP is the same as <nohtml>IP</nohtml>: "IP" won't get hyper-
	linked in the HTML output, even if there's a module type called IP.
	Single backslashes will be removed from the HTML output -- double
	them if you want them to appear.

2004-08-09  Andras Varga

	* opp_neddoc.in: on Windows, listing directories which have no .ned
	or .msg on the command line caused opp_neddoc stop with "file not
	found" error

2004-07-22  ------ omnetpp-3.0a6 released ------

2004-07-20  Andras Varga

	* neddoc.xsl: "NED file" pages in generated HTML now contain full
	NED file listing

	* opp_neddoc.in, neddoc.xsl: added -z (--no-source) option to turn off
	adding the source code on component pages (but NED file pages will
	still contain the source)

2004-07-19  Andras Varga

	* opp_nmakemake,opp_makemake: added -x (--notstamp) option: the
	makefile won't require a .tstamp file to be present in directories
	that appear after the -x option on the command line.

	* opp_neddoc: added support for tags @author, @date, @todo, @bug,
	@see, @since, @warning, @version

2004-07-16  Andras Varga

	* opp_test: added preload-ned-files=*.ned to default omnetpp.ini

2004-07-12  Andras Varga

	* opp_makemake.in,opp_nmakemake: fixed bug which caused .tstamp to be
	always updated, and thus depended directories to be always re-built.

2004-07-10  Andras Varga

	* opp_test: added further checks: %contains-filt, %not-contains-filt,
	%contains-regex-filt, %not-contains-regex-filt. These checks
	regard only the lines beginning with "::" in the output (all other
	lines will be discarded before match). This makes it easier to
	write test cases if the test code produces lots of output.

2004-06-07  ------ omnetpp-3.0a5 released ------

2004-05-15  ------ omnetpp-3.0a4 released ------

2004-05-15  Andras Varga

	* opp_neddoc.in: prefer ImageMagick's convert to Ghostscript when
	converting EPS to JPG. Many Ghostscript versions do not crop EPS files:
	they ignore the -dEPSCrop flag and the %%BoundingBox line in the EPS
	file. (One GS that I tested and works well is AFPL Ghostscript 8.11.)
	ImageMagick also uses Ghostscript to do the conversion but works
	around the problem: adds the line "120 45 translate" to the front of
	the EPS file (where the numbers are -1 times the top-left corner of
	the %%BoundingBox) before invoking GS, then after GS it crops the
	resulting raster image to the correct size.

2004-04-14  Andras Varga

	* neddoc.xsl: fixed bug which caused some inheritance arrows to be
	drawn in wrong direction

2004-03-22  ------ omnetpp-3.0a3 released ------

2004-03-05  Andras Varga

	* opp_makemake: added --genconfig option which generates config file
	which can be included by makefiles (see opp_makemake -c option).

	* opp_makemake, opp_nmakemake: old targets "re-makemake" and
	"re-makemake-m" renamed to "makefiles" and "makefile-ins".
	Old target names also kept for compatibility but should not be used
	any more.

	* opp_nmakemake: some quirks fixed; used "exit /b 1" to return error
	code (not good without /b!)

2004-03-04  Andras Varga

	* opp_makemake, opp_nmakemake: improved dealing with .msg files.
	To deal with dependencies within a single directory, an
	   $(OBJS) : $(GENERATEDHEADERS)
	dependency was added which forces opp_msgc run first. For dealing
	with multi-directory models, there's a "generateheaders" target
	which the toplevel makefile can depend on, forcing to generate
	all _m.h files before actual compilation begins. The toplevel
	makefile should contain the following dependency then:
	   subdirs $(OBJS) : generateheaders
	(It is not good to add this to every makefile, because it'll
	run too many times, cascading...)

2004-03-03  ------ omnetpp-3.0a2 released ------

2004-03-03  Andras Varga

	* opp_makemake, opp_nmakemake: makefiles now generate a .tstamp
	file on successful build. Useful with multi-directory models:
	with -w option, the generated makefile will depend on the timestamps
	of included directories, so e.g. a simulation executable gets re-built
	automatically if its components in other directories have been changed
	*and* built.

	ATTENTION: this doesn't guarantee that other directories are
	up-to date!!! Only that *when* they are re-built, executables that
	use them will be re-built too. You still have to do a top-level make
	if you want to ensure that included directories are up-to-date too.

	* opp_makemake, opp_nmakemake: re-makemake target made recursive
	[suggested by Daniel Willkomm]

2004-02-22  Andras Varga

	* opp_test: added -a, -N options. -N can be used to test dynamic
	NED loading

2004-02-18  Andras Varga

	* opp_makemake.in: -N, --ignore-ned added (see below)

2004-02-09  Andras Varga

	* opp_nmakemake: added -N, --ignore-ned option which leaves out .ned
	files from the makefile. Useful when you want to load all .ned files
	dynamically instead of linking them into the simulation program
	(see preload-ned-files omnetpp.ini option).

2004-02-06  Andras Varga

	* opp_makemake.in,opp_nmakemake: 'depend' target made recursive

2004-02-04  ------ omnetpp-3.0pre1 released ------

2004-02-03  Andras Varga

	* neddoc.xsl: module etc names in generated .dot files need quotes
	otherwise they may clash with dot's reserved keywords ("Node")

2003-12-06  Andras Varga

	* opp_nmakemake now will make some effort to find configuser.vc
	by itself when no -c option is given

2003-12-05  Andras Varga

	* opp_neddoc and parts polished and brought to work on Windows.
	See tests at test/opp_neddoc.

2003-10-02  Andras Varga

	* opp_makemake.in, opp_nmakemake: a thorough rewrite of how
	multi-directory models are handled. This version should be usable,
	it's been proven on IPSuite and MPLS (I generated _all_ of its
	Makefiles including the toplevel one with opp_(n)makemake).
	The changes in nutshell:
	- opp_(n)makemake no longer invokes `make' in other directories
	  while generating the makefile. (It wasn't a very good idea in
	  the first place)
	- it is now possible to generate a Makefile that imports the
	  settings from another file (via Makefile inclusion). Thus
	  you don't have to regenerate all the Makefiles (or edit the
	  settings in them) if you move to a different machine or change
	  the compile flags.
	- "recursive make" (descenting into subdirs) is now independent
	  from which directories you want to link with object files.
	  Recursive make is enabled with the -r option, and it'll simply
	  cause the Makefile to go into all subdirs and run make in them.
	  That's all. If you need to ensure a specific order or you want
	  to leave out certain subdirs, you can put additional dependencies
	  and rules into makefrag (makefrag.vc).
	- any file you list on the opp_(n)makemake command line is still
	  something to link with. No change here.
	- any directory on the opp_(n)makemake command line is a something
	  that (will) contain object files you want to link with.
	  opp_(n)makemake won't specifically list the object files in the
	  Makefile, it'll just say *.o (or *.obj). Also, it won't add
	  dependencies to that directory -- you have to add that manually
	  (see "recursive make" above).
	- one shortcut I found useful: the -w option causes linking with all
	  object files found in the -I (include) directories. That saves you
	  from listing directories with -I (because you want to import NED
	  files from there and #include header files) and again as argument
	  (because you also want to link with the object files from there) --
	  you just add -w, and the -I's.
	Note that primarily, linking with object files is considered and not
	building static or shared libraries. Putting modules into static
	libraries doesn't work very well on Unix (the linker tends to optimize
	too eagerly and leave out your modules from the executable), but
	shared libraries are fine. On Windows, static libs have the same
	problem as on Unix; DLLs are more difficult to build.
	   Any customization should go to the makefrag(.vc) file. The above
	machinery should probably be satisfactory for except very large and
	very modular simulation models. If you find that you've outgrown
	the opp_makemake features, you should probably consider moving to
	CMake or Automake which are far more powerful.

2003-08-20  Andras Varga

	* opp_makemake.in, opp_nmakemake: added missing dependency of _m.h
	files on .msg files.

2003-07-28  Andras Varga

	* opp_neddoc/opp_neddocall: enhanced documentation generation, output
	is now multi-frame html. Generated files go to the html/ subdirectory.

2003-06-16  ------ omnetpp-2.3 released ------

2003-05-24  Andras Varga

	* opp_nmakemake: changed handling of -e option -- now, if no -e option
	is given, opp_nmakemake tries to detect the C++ file extension
	from files already in the directory.

2003-03-15  ------ omnetpp-2.3b2 released ------

2003-03-15  Andras Varga

	* opp_nmakemake: fixed -l and -L options; clarified help text

2003-03-13  Andras Varga

	* opp_test: changed #include "omnetpp.h" to <omnetpp.h> in generated
	code

2003-03-11  Andras Varga

	* opp_test: couldn't run test program on Unix if "." was not
	in the PATH

2003-02-15  ------ omnetpp-2.3b1 released ------

2003-02-08  Andras Varga

	* opp_test: enhancement: %contains and %not-contains now do
	substring match. Regexp match can be done with %contains-regex
	and %not-contains-regex.

2003-01-30  Andras Varga

	* opp_makemake.in: now runs make depend after makefile creation

2002-12-18  Andras Varga

	* opp_stacktool.cmd added: it displays maximum reserved stack size
	for a program.

	* seedtool.cc: incorporated fix from N. Reijers. If too many seeds,
	too far apart are requested, there were zeroes in the generated
	sequence. (See src for more info.)

2002-12-08  Andras Varga

	* opp_makemake, opp_nmakemake: handling of .ned files that use the
	'experimental message subclassing' feature has changed. These files
	should have .msg suffix, and they will be compiled by opp_msgc into
	_m.h and _m.cc files. The '//--subclassing--' line is no longer needed.

2002-12-06  Andras Varga

	* added opp_neddocall: it documents all ned files in the current
	directory and subdirectories.

	* opp_makemake_vc.pl renamed to opp_nmakemake

	* use .cmd files with NT command line extensions (%~ notation)
	to run opp_test, opp_makedep, opp_nmakemake and splitvec from Windows
	command prompt

	* removed 'require Cwd' from perl scripts: we don't want to use any
	Perl modules, to avoid having to bundle a full Perl distribution into
	the Windows installer

2002-11-14  Andras Varga

	* opp_test: changes for Windows

	* opp_makemake_vc.pl: added makefile creator for MSVC. 100% Perl,
	no other Unix tool needed. The created Makefile.vc includes
	configuser.vc for all compiler, linker, etc settings.

2002-10-30  Andras Varga

	* tcl2c.c: commented out old code for Borland C++, it was in the way
	when compiling with MinGW. BC is not supported anyway.

2002-10-19  Andras Varga

	* opp_test: added %global option; it can be used with %activity
	and its body will be placed into the C++ source at global scope,
	so it's a good place for helper functions, etc.

2002-06-12  Ulrich Kaage  <kaage@int.uni-karlsruhe.de>

	* opp_makemake.in (htmldocs): Target htmldoc renamed to
	htmldocs. Now, creates directory htmldoc instead of html
	(clean): remove automatically generated documentation
	(htmldocs): use | instead of / as sed separator where file pathes
	can occur

2002-06-11  Ulrich Kaage  <kaage@int.uni-karlsruhe.de>

	* opp_makemake.in (doxyconf): new variable; names the doxygen
	configuration file
	(nedfiles): new variable, holds all ned files including those in
	sub-directories
	(neddoc.html): new Makefile target for NED documentation
	generation. Creates neddoc.html
	(htmldoc): new Makefile target for C++ code documentation
	generation. Docu is placed into ./html sub-directory
	(doc): new Makefile target that calls target neddoc.html and
	htmldoc
	(): various code for NED file collection; exludes NED files that
	contain experimental subclassing ("//--subclassing--")

	* opp_neddoc.in: use OMNETPP_UTILS_DIR as path to
	neddoc.xsl. Added signal traps and a cleanup() function

2002-06-10  Ulrich Kaage  <kaage@int.uni-karlsruhe.de>

	* Makefile.in (all): copy opp_neddoc to bin dir.

	* opp_neddoc.in (NEDDOC_XSL): use OMNETPP_UTILS_DIR as path to
	neddoc.xsl

2002-07-07  Andras Varga

	* added NED documentation tool (neddoc.xsl, opp_neddoc,
	opp_neddoc.cmd)

2002-05-04  ------ omnetpp-2.2 released ------

2002-04-06  Andras Varga

	* opp_test added (moved here from test/); makefile installs it into bin/
	* makedep.pl renamed to opp_makedep and made a standalone program;
	makefile installs it into bin/

2002-04-02  Ulrich Kaage <kaage@int.uni-karlsruhe.de>  <kaage@int.etec.uni-karlsruhe.de>

	* opp_makemake.in (): when parsing option -u: use brackets around
	tr groups

2002-03-03  Andras Varga

	* opp_makemake: added -L option; removed Makefile.in from the depend
	target. [patch by Johnny Lai]

2002-01-23  Ulrich Kaage  <kaage@int.uni-karlsruhe.de>

	* opp_makemake.in (clean): remove also *_n.h files.

2001-10-18  Ulrich Kaage  <kaage@int.uni-karlsruhe.de>

	* opp_makemake.in: introduced NEDCFLAGS and NEDCOPTS so that
	compile flag -Wno-unused can be used for compiling _n.cc files
	only. NEDCFLAGS is defined in configure.in and set in
	configure.user in the top level directory.

2001-08-28  Andras Varga

	* added makedep.pl. The makedepend program in newer XFree versions
	(4.0 up?) is unusable because it no longer supports the -Y option :(
	This Perl script I found on the web and enhanced it significantly.

2001-06-19  Ulrich Kaage  <kaage@int.uni-karlsruhe.de>

	* Makefile.in (all): use "ln -sf" instead of "ln -s" to avoid an
	error when link already exists.

2001-05-24 Andras Varga

	* ------ omnetpp-2.1 released ------

	* prephtml, wc-l moved to _scripts
