	* The new 'scalar' command can apply processing operations too.
	Currently only the 'scatter' operation accepted, and it creates
	a scatter plot dataset from the scalars. Its format is:
	"scatter(module,scalar,...)" where
	  - module,scalar: identifies the scalar selected for the X axis
	  - additional arguments identifies the iso attributes, they are
            module, scalar pairs or names of run attributes

	* 'filter' command of scavetool had been split into 'vector' and
	'scalar' commands.

	* library renamed to oppscave

	* Started the ChangeLog. The Scave library was added in omnetpp-4.0.
	It implements reading and processing of result files (output vector
	files .vec, and output scalar files .sca) and it is used by the
	Analysis tool in IDE. A command-line tool scavetool is also provided.
	Initial code was taken from the 3.x Plove and Scalars tools, then
	it was significantly expanded by Tamas Borbely.
