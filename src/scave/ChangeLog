	* Changes to allow implementing computed scalars in the IDE

2012-03-28  Andras Varga

	* scaveutils.cc: fixed #546: parseDouble() now understands
	MSVC's 1.#INF syntax (as well as all other sane syntaxes for
	infinity and NaN)

2011-02-23  ------ omnetpp-4.2b1 released ------

2011-01-21  Tamas Borbely

	* added -g option to 'scavetool scalar' command. The user can specify
	how the scalars are grouped into columns/variables. The default is also changed:
	each scalar value is written into one column (csv) or variable. This
	allows the user to import the csv into a spreadsheet and use the
	'pivot table' functionality to group the scalars as he likes.
	Old behaviour can be obtained by '-g name'.

2010-07-13  Tamas Borbely

	* added "substractFirstValue" filter, it substracts the first finite value
	  from the first and all subsequent values.

2010-05-31  ------ omnetpp-4.1rc2 released ------

2010-04-20  ------ omnetpp-4.1b4 released ------

2010-04-20  Andras Varga

	* fixed "timeavg" filter not to assume an initial (0,0) data point,
	and to suppress potential initial 0/0 = NaN (or NaNs)

	* fixed "integrate" filter not to assume an initial (0,0) data point

2010-03-14  ------ omnetpp-4.1b3 released ------

2009-09-04  Tamas Borbely

	* added 'sum' function to 'aggregator' node.

2009-05-15  Tamas Borbely

	* added 'aggregator' node for computing average/minimum/maximum of
	several vectors. It simply aggregates the values at the same simulation
	time (i.e. ignores interpolation-mode of the vectors).

2009-05-11  Tamas Borbely

	* added 'timewinavg' node. It computes the average of data points
	in fixed, equal length time intervals.

2009-03-12  ------ omnetpp-4.0 released ------

2009-02-27  ------ omnetpp-4.0rc2 released ------

2009-02-22: Andras Varga

	* added descriptions to the examples in the scavetool help text.

	* documented the "scalar" filter in the scavetool help text.

2009-02-19 Tamas Borbely

	* Renamed 'summary' command of scavetool to 'list'.

2009-02-19  Tamas Borbely

	* The new 'scalar' command can apply processing operations too.
	Currently only the 'scatter' operation accepted, and it creates
	a scatter plot dataset from the scalars. Its format is:
	"scatter(module,scalar,...)" where
	  - module,scalar: identifies the scalar selected for the X axis
	  - additional arguments identifies the iso attributes, they are
	    module, scalar pairs or names of run attributes

2009-02-19  Tamas Borbely

	* 'filter' command of scavetool had been split into 'vector' and
	'scalar' commands.

2008-12-12  ------ omnetpp-4.0rc1 released ------

2008-11-26  Andras Varga

	* library renamed to oppscave

2008-02-23  Andras Varga

	* Started the ChangeLog. The Scave library was added in omnetpp-4.0.
	It implements reading and processing of result files (output vector
	files .vec, and output scalar files .sca) and it is used by the
	Analysis tool in IDE. A command-line tool scavetool is also provided.
	Initial code was taken from the 3.x Plove and Scalars tools, then
	it was significantly expanded by Tamas Borbely.
