2017-02-06  ------ omnetpp-5.1pre3 released ------

2016-12-23  Andras Varga

	* scavetool: added "query -f" option (add statistics fields as
	scalars)

2016-12-22  Andras Varga

	* scavetool refinements:
	- -r (list runs) to respect -D (run display format)
	- issue warning when no input files are given
	- understand "scavetool <command> -h/--help"

2016-12-23  ------ omnetpp-5.1pre2 released ------

2016-12-12  Andras Varga

	* scavetool: added query functionality, reorganized help into pages,
	autoindex vector files, etc.

	Details:
	- added 'query' subcommand
	- reorganized help into pages ('scavetool help <topic>')
	- 'info' subcommand merged into help (use 'help filters')
	- 'list' subcommand merged into 'query'
	-  default output file name changed to 'out.<ext>'

2016-12-12  Andras Varga

	* scavetool: internal refactoring
	- use exceptions for error handling
	- use C++ I/O instead of printf
	- turned into a class

2016-12-12  Andras Varga

	* export.cc: ScalarDataTable: fix NPE

2016-12-13  Andras Varga

	* ResultFileManager: added new methods filterIDList() and
	getUniqueModuleAndResultNamePairs()

2016-11-30  Rudolf Hornig

	* build: Makefile refactored. Added clang-c2 support and optimized
	the build process.

	* build: removed Makefile.vc, as Visual C++ builds are now handled
	by the standard Makefiles.

2016-11-25  Andras Varga

	* Revised SQLite-related code: error handling, internal logic,
	refactoring, etc.

	SQLite result files are mostly automatically detected and used by
	the library and scavetool.

	Implementation: result file loading was factored out of
	ResultFileManager, and done via two loaders: OmnetppResultFileLoader
	and SqliteResultFileLoader. For processing output vector data,
	an SqliteVectorReader class was added. There are two new node types:
	"sqlitevectorreader" and "vectorreaderbyfiletype"; the latter
	looks at the result file given to it, and instantiates either
	an OMNeT++ vector file reader or an SQLite vector file reader.

2016-11-23  Andras Varga

	* Added initial support for SQLite-based result files [Zoltan Bojthe]

2016-12-06  Andras Varga

	* DEFAULT_PRECISION renamed to DEFAULT_RESULT_PRECISION

2016-12-05  Andras Varga

	* isVectorFile() renamed to isExistingVectorFile(), and made it check
	file contents too. This is necessary so that the code can tell OMNeT++
	result files from SQLite result files.

2016-11-10  Andras Varga

	* Error messages refined (start with capital letter, use apostrophes
	for quoting, etc.)

2016-09-01  Rudolf Hornig

	* scavetool: include run attributes in scalar data exports

2016-06-23  Rudolf Hornig

	* The makefile now uses compiler-generated dependency files.

2016-04-13  ------ omnetpp-5.0 released ------

2016-03-10  ------ omnetpp-5.0rc released ------

2015-12-07  ------ omnetpp-5.0b3 released ------

2015-10-16  Andras Varga

	* omnetpp namespace made permanent (cannot be turned off):
	- removed configure option and preprocessor symbol USE_NAMESPACE
	- removed related macros: NAMESPACE_BEGIN, NAMESPACE_END,
	  USING_NAMESPACE, OPP, OPP_STR, OPP_PREFIX etc.

2015-07-20  ------ omnetpp-5.0b2 released ------

2015-06-16  Andras Varga

	* Cleanup: prefer ++it to it++ (less copying)

2015-06-08  Andras Varga

	* Cleanup: longer header guards

2015-06-08  Andras Varga

	* Cleanup: code formatting

2015-05-15  Andras Varga

	* Cleanup: use per-folder nested namespaces: omnetpp::envir, omnetpp::tkenv,
	omnetpp::layout, omnetpp::common, omnetpp::eventlog, etc.

2015-05-22  Andras Varga

	* Modernizing: added the 'override' keyword (C++11) to overridden methods;
	it becomes blank when using with an older compiler.

2015-05-21  Rudolf Hornig

	* Modernizing: replaced NULLs by 'nullptr' (C++11); it is defined as 0
	when using an older compiler.

2015-05-11  Andras Varga

	* Cleanup: data members renamed to camelCase

2015-04-20  Andras Varga

	* Cleanup: use C++ names of C headers (e.g. <cstdio> instead of <stdio.h>)

2015-04-12  Andras Varga

	* Cleanup: copyright years updated

2015-04-08  Andras Varga

	* Modernizing:

	- Use a fixed include path (-Iinclude -Isrc) for all source folders
	  under src/, and qualify cross-folder #includes with the folder
	  name (e.g. change #include "stringutil.h" to #include "common/stringutil.h").
	  This increases readbility and reduces the chance of including a wrong
	  header.

	- In source files, sort #include statements by folder.

	* Changes to allow implementing computed scalars in the IDE

2012-03-28  Andras Varga

	* scaveutils.cc: fixed #546: parseDouble() now understands
	MSVC's 1.#INF syntax (as well as all other sane syntaxes for
	infinity and NaN)

2011-02-23  ------ omnetpp-4.2b1 released ------

2011-01-21  Tamas Borbely

	* added -g option to 'scavetool scalar' command. The user can specify
	how the scalars are grouped into columns/variables. The default is also changed:
	each scalar value is written into one column (csv) or variable. This
	allows the user to import the csv into a spreadsheet and use the
	'pivot table' functionality to group the scalars as he likes.
	Old behaviour can be obtained by '-g name'.

2010-07-13  Tamas Borbely

	* added "substractFirstValue" filter, it substracts the first finite value
	  from the first and all subsequent values.

2010-05-31  ------ omnetpp-4.1rc2 released ------

2010-04-20  ------ omnetpp-4.1b4 released ------

2010-04-20  Andras Varga

	* fixed "timeavg" filter not to assume an initial (0,0) data point,
	and to suppress potential initial 0/0 = NaN (or NaNs)

	* fixed "integrate" filter not to assume an initial (0,0) data point

2010-03-14  ------ omnetpp-4.1b3 released ------

2009-09-04  Tamas Borbely

	* added 'sum' function to 'aggregator' node.

2009-05-15  Tamas Borbely

	* added 'aggregator' node for computing average/minimum/maximum of
	several vectors. It simply aggregates the values at the same simulation
	time (i.e. ignores interpolation-mode of the vectors).

2009-05-11  Tamas Borbely

	* added 'timewinavg' node. It computes the average of data points
	in fixed, equal length time intervals.

2009-03-12  ------ omnetpp-4.0 released ------

2009-02-27  ------ omnetpp-4.0rc2 released ------

2009-02-22: Andras Varga

	* added descriptions to the examples in the scavetool help text.

	* documented the "scalar" filter in the scavetool help text.

2009-02-19 Tamas Borbely

	* Renamed 'summary' command of scavetool to 'list'.

2009-02-19  Tamas Borbely

	* The new 'scalar' command can apply processing operations too.
	Currently only the 'scatter' operation accepted, and it creates
	a scatter plot dataset from the scalars. Its format is:
	"scatter(module,scalar,...)" where
	  - module,scalar: identifies the scalar selected for the X axis
	  - additional arguments identifies the iso attributes, they are
	    module, scalar pairs or names of run attributes

2009-02-19  Tamas Borbely

	* 'filter' command of scavetool had been split into 'vector' and
	'scalar' commands.

2008-12-12  ------ omnetpp-4.0rc1 released ------

2008-11-26  Andras Varga

	* library renamed to oppscave

2008-02-23  Andras Varga

	* Started the ChangeLog. The Scave library was added in omnetpp-4.0.
	It implements reading and processing of result files (output vector
	files .vec, and output scalar files .sca) and it is used by the
	Analysis tool in IDE. A command-line tool scavetool is also provided.
	Initial code was taken from the 3.x Plove and Scalars tools, then
	it was significantly expanded by Tamas Borbely.
