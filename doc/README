OMNeT++ Discrete Event Simulation System
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

OMNeT++ is a public-source, component-based, modular and open-architecture
simulation environment with strong GUI support and an embeddable simulation
kernel. Its primary application area is the simulation of communication
networks, but it has been successfully used in other areas like the simulation
of IT systems, queueing networks, hardware architectures and business processes
as well.

If you installed the source distribution, the omnetpp directory on your system
should contain the following subdirectories. (If you installed a precompiled
distribution, some of the directories may be missing, or there might be
additional directories, e.g. containing software bundled with OMNeT++.)

The simulation system itself:

  omnetpp/         OMNeT++ root directory
    bin/           OMNeT++ executables (GNED, nedtool, etc.)
    include/       header files for simulation models
    lib/           library files
    images/        icons that can be used in network graphics
    doc/           manual (PDF), readme, license, etc.
      manual/      manual in HTML
      tictoc-tutorial/  introduction into using OMNeT++
      api/         API reference in HTML
      nedxml-api/  API reference for the NEDXML library
      src/         sources of the documentation
    src/           OMNeT++ sources
      nedxml/      nedtool, message compiler, NED infrastructure
      sim/         simulation kernel
        parsim/    files for distributed execution
        netbuilder/files for dynamically reading NED files
      envir/       common code for user interfaces
      cmdenv/      command-line user interface
      tkenv/       Tcl/Tk-based user interface
      layout/      graph layouting library
      scave/       library for processing result files
      eventlog/    library for processing event log files
      common/      common utility classes
      utils/       makefile generator and various utilities
    test/          regression test suite
      core/        regression test suite for the simulation library
      distrib/     regression test suite for built-in distributions
      ...

Sample simulations are in the samples directory.

    samples/     directories for sample simulations
      aloha/     models the Aloha protocol
      cqn/       Closed Queueing Network
      ...

The contrib directory contains material from the OMNeT++ community.

    contrib/     directory for contributed material
      octave/    Octave scripts for result processing
      emacs/     NED syntax highlight for Emacs


The example programs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The example programs are designed to demonstrate many of the features of
OMNeT++. We recommend that you try tictoc first, which also has an
accompanying tutorial under doc/.


Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you're installing from a source distribution, please read one of the
following files for instructions, depending on your OS and compiler:
   Readme.MinGW   -- Windows + MinGW
   Readme.Unix    -- generic Unix/Linux
   Readme.OSX     -- Mac OS/X


Enjoy.

Andras Varga and the OMNeT++ Team.
