Introduction
============

The NED language went through a thorough redesign process for the 4.0
release. Every corner of the language was taken apart, analyzed, and
changed if necessary. We wanted a language which lives up to the
requirements generated by the appearance of large simulation frameworks, is
reasonably extensible, and has a familiar, consistent and concise syntax.

The goals did not make it possible to keep the original (3.x) NED syntax.
However, because the basic structure of the language remains the same, it
is possible to automatically convert existing 3.x NED files into the new
syntax. In our experience, automatic conversion works flawlessly, and
manual editing is very rarely needed before simulation models are up and
running again, with the new syntax. Manual work is needed, obviously, to
change the converted NED code to actually take advantage of new language
features: default icons, default parameter values, physical unit
annotations, inout gates and bidirectional connections, local types, and so
on.

The most significant changes are:
  - changed to curly brace syntax
  - channels became first-class types
  - added module and channel interfaces, to formalize "like" relationships
  - added inheritance (may add/refine parametes, gates, submodules, connections)
  - added inner types (primarily to allow local channel definitions)
  - added Java-like package system and imports
  - split "numeric" parameter type to int and double
  - non-const parameters are now called volatile (const is no more)
  - expressions can now work with string and XML types as well
  - const subexpressions (planned)
  - support for "like" submodule vectors where each module is of different
    NED type (syntax: foo[5]: <> like IFoo; inifile: **.foo[*].typename = "Foo")
  - assignment of parameters using wildcard patterns (planned)
  - added inout gates and bidirectional connections
  - the in/out "halves" of inout gates may connected independently
  - more flexible gate vectors (size can be set inside or outside the module type)
  - added conditional connection groups
  - added support for default display string (default icon, color etc) for module and channel types
  - added "properties" (@foo(value[s]) syntax; useful for various annotations)
  - display string turned into property (@display)
  - added handling of physical units and their conversion (@unit property)
  - added support for C++ namespaces (@namespace property)
  - added support for explicitly specifying C++ implementation class (@class property)
  - parameter prompt string became @prompt property
  - further usage of properties envisioned (gate labelling, statistics declaration, etc)
  - dropped feature: conditional parameters and gatesizes sections (?: can be used instead)
  - dropped feature: ancestor parameters (violates encapsulation principle)
  - dropped feature: ref keyword (parameters are now always taken by reference)
  - no more implicit conversion between bool and long/double

Before delving into the details, let us see a code example. This is a
variant of the well-known one-FIFO queueing network, in the new NED syntax:

  //
  // Generates jobs (messages) with the given interarrival
  // time and length. Both can be random variates, returning
  // different values for each job.
  //
  simple Source
  {
      parameters:
          volatile double sendIaTime @unit(s);
          volatile int msgLength = default(100);
          @display("i=block/source");
      gates:
          output out;
  }


  //
  // A single-server queue
  //
  simple Fifo
  {
      parameters:
          volatile double serviceTime @unit(s);
          @display("i=block/queue;q=queue");
      gates:
          input in;
          output out;
  }

  //
  // Destroys the packets and collects statistics
  //
  simple Sink
  {
      parameters:
          @display("i=block/sink");
      gates:
          input in;
  }

  //
  // Simple queueing network: generator + FIFO + sink.
  //
  network FifoNet
  {
      submodules:
          gen: Source {
              @display("p=89,100");
          };
          fifo: Fifo {
              @display("p=209,100");
          };
          sink: Sink {
              @display("p=329,100");
          };
      connections:
          gen.out --> fifo.in;
          fifo.out --> sink.in;
  }



Syntax
======

Surely the first thing you have noticed is the curly braces. We changed
from using the "endsimple", "endmodule", "endnetwork" and "endchannel"
keywords to the curly brace syntax, which is probably more familiar to most
readers, and also saves typing.

Submodule parameters and gates are now placed within a "submodule body"
curly-braced block as well, which makes it clearer for a novice reader to identify
where they belong. A side effect is that a submodule's source code would
now be one line longer (with the "}" occupying a separate line), but since
we also made the "parameters:" keyword optional, the line count is back
where it was before.

Note that display strings are now specified with the "@display(...)"
syntax. The different syntax signifies that the display string has become
an instance of something called "property". Properties take the form
"@somename(arglist)", and they allow the NED code to be annotated with all
sorts of meta-information. A parameters block may actually contain
any mix of parameters and module/submodule properties. Properties can
be used to annotate parameters and gates as well.

For module parameters, note that each module parameter is now terminated
with a semicolon (so the parameter list is not a comma-separated list with
a semicolon at the end anymore) -- which will probably be a very welcome
change.

The so far somewhat ah-hoc syntax for declaring parameters and gates has been
made consistent as well: now it is "<type> <name>;" for both.



Parameters
==========

Types
-----

The "numeric" parameter type has been split to "double" and "int". (Int is
actually represented as "long" in the C++ code.) When converting a 3.x NED
file to the new syntax, the tool will conservatively change "numeric" to
"double" everywhere; it is recommmended to review the source afterwards,
and manually change "double" to "int" where appropriate.

const/volatile
--------------

The "const" keyword in 3.x has traditionally caused some confusion for most
users. The purpose of "const" was to declare that a parameter is to be
evaluated only once, during initialization, and any subsequest read
operation should return that value. That is, repeatedly reading a const
parameter with the value "exponential(1)" would yield, say, 0.67853375367
all the time, while a similar non-const parameter would produce a random
number stream.

To make the semantics more intuitive, we changed the syntax: "const" is now
the default, and non-const parameters are marked with the "volatile"
keyword. That is, we have now "int numHosts" and "volatile double
packetInterval". "volatile" conveys the meaning that every time you read
the parameter from the simulation, you might get a different value. This is
also consistent with the C/C++/Java meaning of the keyword ("should not be
cached"), because a volatile module parameter should be re-read each time
it is needed, and not cached in a variable.

Non-volatile (formerly "const") parameters are converted to a constant
value at the beginning of the simulation.

Note that in the above Fifo model, the parameters "sendIaTime", "msgLength"
and "serviceTime" are all declared volatile. If they are assigned values
like "exponential(1)", messages should be generated and services at random
intervals.

Automatic conversion of NED files performs the "const"/"volatile"
conversion correctly. However, because in many 3.x simulation models the
authors forgot to write out the "const" keyword, unintended "volatile"
keywords may appear in the NED files -- so users should review all
"volatile"'s after the conversion, and remove the unwanted ones.


Defaults
--------

In the 3.x NED, module parameters could only be assigned a value in a
submodule's "parameters" section, but not in the module type where the
parameter was declared. This has been changed: now you can also supply
a value immediately in the parameter declaration. This value may be
overwritten where the module is used as a submodule (and also in
subclasses, see later).

As for the value, you can provide either a concrete value, or a default
(using the "default(...)" syntax). The use of default values is that they
can be simply applied in the ini files (**.parameterName.apply-default =
true, or **.apply-default = true), significantly reducing the size of ini
files needed to configure the simulation model.


Expressions
-----------

Expressions occur at several places in NED files: parameter values, gate
vector and module vector sizes, module and gate indexing in connections,
connection "for" loop start and stop values, and so on. Expression
evaluation has also changed significantly from the 3.x releases.

Formerly, expressions involving strings were not supported, and booleans
were internally treated as numbers (a'la C). String operations are now
possible, and it is also possible to extend the NED language with functions
that accept string arguments, or return a string. The same is true for XML
parameters: one can create functions that operate on, or return, XML trees.

One non backward-compatible change is that now there is no implicit
conversion between numeric types and boolean. That is, trying to assign a
boolean to an integer or double parameter will result in an error instead
of producing "0" or "1"; and similarly, using an int or double as a boolean
value is now an error. Such expressions need to be changed to "boolvar ? 1
: 0" and "numericvar==0", respectively. We think that this change will contribute
to the cleanliness of NED files, without causing significant inconvenience.


Units
-----

Expecting a module parameter in one physical unit, then assigning a value
in another unit has always been a potential source of errors. (Just think
of the legendary Mars probe, which crashed because of mixing up metric and
English units of force!)

In the new NED language, it is possible to specify which unit a parameter
is understood in. This is done by adding "@unit(<unitname>)" to the
declaration; for example, "@unit(mW)" for milliwatts, and "@unit(m)" for
meters. It is also possible to specify the unit for numeric literals (e.g.
"20mW" or "150m") in NED and ini files, and the simulation kernel will
assert that the two units match.

OMNeT++ knows about certain base units, which are "s" (second), "bps" (bit
per second), "B" (byte), "b" (bit), "m" (meter), "W" (watt), and "Hz"
(Herz). It also knows about widely used multiples of these units, for
example "h" (hour), "ns" (nanosecond), "Gbps" (gigabit per second), "MB"
(megabyte), "mW" (milliwatt) etc, and can convert from those into the
respective base units. Unrecognized units ("N", "bogomips", etc) are
accepted, but there is no conversion for them (so "1kN" is never converted
into "1000 N", for example).

The rules of assigning a value to a parameter are as follows.

 - if the value has a unit but the parameter doesn't, an error is raised.

 - if the parameter has a unit but the value doesn't, the value interpreted
   as being in the unit of the parameter.

 - if neither the parameter nor the value has a unit, it is accepted.

 - if both have units, but the units differ and cannot be converted into
   each other, it is an error.

 - if both have units, and they are equal or can be converted into each
   other ("W" and "mW"), then the conversion takes place if needed.

An extra rule is that OMNeT++ 4.0 does not allow numbers with units
("12ms") within arithmetic expressions, only as standalone values. This is
a precaution, as OMNeT++ is currently NOT prepared to infer the unit of an
expression from its parts, and we do not want a user mistakenly believe it
does. For example, "floor(10.2ms)+0.5" is not allowed, because OMNeT++ does
not know its unit, and would happily assign it to a parameter with
"@unit(s)" as "10.5" -- which would then become "10.5s" (!).
"(floor(10.2)+0.5)/1000" is legal. It is also legal to state explicitly the
unit of an expression (that is, the unit which the resulting number is to
be interpreted in), by appending the unit in square brackets. That is,
"(floor(10.2)+0.5) [ms]" is also legal, and will cause the numeric value to
be multiplied by 1000 when assigned to a parameter with "unit(s)".

One point of non backward compatibility is that multiple numbers and units
("1h 22s 550ms") are no longer supported. This syntax was very rarely
used in practice, so very few users are affected.




New texT:
Unit checking & conversion: unfortunately it can only be done at runtime (cDynamicExpression),
     because of registered NED functions are not available in NEDXML, and inifile values are hard to
     analyze statically in NEDXML too.

     solution: - units checked by cDynamicExpression, during expression evaluation.
               - NED functions also get units in StkValue, and check them at runtime.
               - functions: replaceunit(var, "m"); dropunit(var); convertunit(var, "m"); unitof(var)


---------> FIXME change the implementation!!!!


Other Properties
----------------
prompt string
XXX


Conditional sections
--------------------

One exotic and rarely used feature of the 3.x NED is not supported
in the new NED: conditional parameters sections. An example of what
conditional parameters sections looked like:

  queue: Queue[N];
      parameters:
          capacity = 10;
      parameters if index==0:
          capacity = 20;
      parameters if index==N-1:
          capacity = 25;

In the new NED language, this syntax can be replaced with a single
parameter assignment and condition operators (?:) which implement an
"if"-ladder ("if..else if...else if..else if.. else"):

  queue[N]: Queue {
      capacity = index==0 ? 20 : index==N-1 ? 25 : 10;
  }

The automatic NED conversion tool stops with an error when it encounters
conditional sections. The code needs to be manually changed to use "?:",
and then it can be converted.


Gates
=====

Syntax
------

The gate declaration syntax has been made consistent with parameter
declarations, so one now writes "input fromTcp;" and "output toTcp;".


inout gates
-----------

There are now three gate types, "input", "output", and "inout". The
introduction of "inout" gates is probably another welcome addition, which
makes it possible to create two-way connections. We will talk about it
later in detail.


Vector gates
------------

Gate vector size may be declared anywhere, and even overwritten anywhere.
XXX is it good that you define g[10] here, and overwrite it to g[11] later? is this good??? error-prone!!!


Properties
----------

XXX labels that should match



Connections
===========

for, if, etc! and two-way connections
gate$i, gate$o


Properties
==========

of parameters, of gates, of modules, etc
further usage: declaring statistics, channel behaviour, gate matching, etc!

Inheritance
===========

The new NED language supports inheritance of modules. rules of inheritance:
  o for inner types:
     - can I define an inner type with the same name in subclasses? NO
  o for properties:
     - contents will be merged (rules like for display strings: values on
       same key and same position will overwrite old ones)
  o for parameters:
     - type cannot be redefined
     - value may be redefined in subclasses or place of usage
  o for gates:
     - type cannot be redefined
     - vector size may be redefined in subclasses or place of usage
  o for gate/parameter properties:
     - extra properties can be added
     - existing properties can be overridden/extended like for standalone properties (?)
  o for submodules:
     - new submodules may be added, but inherited ones cannot be modified
  o for connections:
     - new connections may be added, but inherited ones cannot be modified

//    - as param values, gate size, param/gate/module/submodule properties may
//      involve conditionals, they are UNDETERMINABLE with static analysis.
//      e.g. one cannot tell with static analysis whether a parameter has
//      been assigned or not.
//    - strange things like multiple assigments would have to be allow too:

//    - INCONSISTENCY: with wildcards, FIRST match counts; with conditional
//      assignments, LAST match counts (it's impossible to do the other way!!!)
//    - for params and gatesizes, it can be easily rewritten to use "?:" operator:
//       example:
//            par = (5 if index<3, 0 otherwise);
//        generalized (v1 if c1, v2 if c2, v3 if c3, otherwise vdefault);
//        same as (c1 ? v1 : c2 ? v2 : c3 ? v3 : vdefault)
//
// - parameter once assigned in base class or type MUST be allowed to be
//   set to a different value in subclass/place of usage!!!
//

// value in itself is interpreted as belonging to key "default"; and one can override
// it with the key=... syntax.
//
// property representation:
//   list of key-valuelist pairs; either key or valuelist can be empty
// actual storage may be:
//   hashtable based on key; content is a list (vector) of values
//
// One property name may occur more than once; runtime effect is that the keys/values will be merged.
// Rules of property merging:
//  - a value at a key/position OVERWRITES earlier value at same key/position.
//  - the '-' value removes value from that position; one van write literal minus as "-"
//    example:
//       @display(i="device/pc",red,10);
//       @display(i=,,77);   ====> results in "i=device/pc,red,77"
//       @display(i=,-);     ====> removes "red", so results is "i=device/pc,,77"
