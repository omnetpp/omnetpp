                THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE


The Win32 binary distribution of OMNeT++/OMNEST contains several open
source components which are covered by their own licenses. These components
are listed below, together with their web sites where you can find more
information and the source code.

We'd like to thank the open source community for developing and making
these packages available. OMNeT++/OMNEST would not have been possible
without them.


Eclipse

The OMNeT++/OMNEST IDE is based on the Eclipse Platform and additional
platform features and plug-ins, distributed under the EPL (Eclipse Public 
License). http://www.eclipse.org.

Tcl/Tk

The Tkenv simulation execution environment is based on Tcl/Tk, an open-source
script language and GUI toolkit, written by James Ousterhout and many others. 
Tcl/Tk is currently available from http://tcltk.sourceforge.net, under a 
BSD-like license.

BLT

BLT is an extension to the Tk toolkit, adding new widgets and miscellaneous
commands. It does not require any patching of the Tcl or Tk source files.
OMNeT++/OMNEST uses BLT mainly for its chart, graph and table (multi-column
listbox) widgets. BLT is available from http://blt.sourceforge.net, and it
is distributed under a BSD-like license.

LibXML2

LibXML2 is an open-source XML parser, written by Daniel Veillard for the GNOME
project. The source is available from http://www.xmlsoft.org. OMNeT++/OMNEST 
is bundled with Win32 binaries maintained by Igor Zlatkovic, and currently 
available from http://www.zlatkovic.com. LibXML and ICONV (also a needed
component) are distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL).

Perl

Some of the tools are written in Perl, an open-source script language
written by Larry Wall. The source is available from http://www.perl.com.
OMNeT++/OMNEST is bundled with files from the ActiveState Perl distribution
(http://www.activestate.com). Perl is distributed under its own Artistic
License.

MinGW and MSYS

A Windows port of gcc, and a minimal Unix-like environment in which typical
makefiles can execute. License: GNU General Public License.
