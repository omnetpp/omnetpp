    <para>
      The &Omnetpp; IDE contains editors, views and other tools to assist you while developing
      your C++ code. C++ files open in the IDE in the C++ source editor. The C++ source editor supports syntax
      highlighting, documentation tooltips, content assist, automatic indentation, code formatting,
      refactoring, and several other useful features. The IDE also allows you to configure the build,
      start the build process, launch simulations, and debug the model without leaving the IDE.
    </para>
    <para>
      Most of these features are provided by the Eclipse CDT (C/C++ Development Tooling)
      project (http://eclipse.org/cdt). This chapter briefly explains the basics of using CDT for
      developing simulation models. If you want to learn more about how to use CDT effectively, we
      recommend that you read the CDT documentation in the IDE help system (Help/Help Content).
    </para>

    <para>
      The &Omnetpp; IDE extends CDT with the following features to make model development easier:

          A new &Omnetpp; project creation wizard allows you to create simple, working
          simulation models in one step.

          Makefiles are automatically generated for your project based on the project build configuration.
          The built-in makefile generator is compatible with the command line [[opp_makemake]] tool,
          and features deep makefiles, recursive make, cross-project references, invoking the message compiler,
          automatic dependency generation, automatic linking with the &Omnetpp; libraries; and
          can build executables, shared libraries or static libraries.

            Project Features: Large projects can be partitioned into smaller units which can be
            independently excluded or included in the build. Disabling parts of the project
            can significantly reduce build time or make it possible to build the project at all.

    <title>Prerequisites</title>
    <para>
      The &Omnetpp;
      IDE (and the &Omnetpp;
      simulation framework itself) requires a preinstalled compiler toolchain to function properly.
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          On Windows: The &Omnetpp;
          distribution comes with a preconfigured MinGW compiler toolchain (MinGW is the Windows port of the
          GCC compiler.) You do not have to install or download anything. The IDE should be able to use the
          MinGW/gcc compiler out of box. <commercial>You can also use the Clang/C2 compiler from your
          Microsoft Visual Studio installation.</commercial>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          On Linux: The default GCC toolchain can be used.
          You have to install the GCC toolchain on your system before trying to compile a simulation with &Omnetpp;.
          Please read the Install Guide for detailed instructions.
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          On Mac OS X: You should install Xcode Developer Tools to get compiler
          support before trying to compile a simulation with &Omnetpp;.

    <para>
      This menu item will bring up the ``New &Omnetpp; Project'' wizard.
      The wizard lets you create an &Omnetpp;-specific project, which includes support
      for NED, MSG and INI file editing, as well as C++ development of simple modules.
    </para>
    <para> On the first page of the wizard, specify the project name and ensure that the ``Support
      C++ Development'' checkbox is selected.</para>

    <title>Editing C++ Code</title>
    <para>
      The &Omnetpp;
      IDE comes with a C/C++ editor. In addition to standard editing features, the C/C++ editor
      provides syntax highlighting, content assistance, and other C++ specific functionality.
      The source is continually parsed as you type, and errors and warnings are displayed as
      markers on the editor rulers.
    </para>
    <picture file="pictures/CPP-Editor.png">C++ source editor</picture>

    <sect2>
      <title>The C++ Editor</title>

      <para> The C++ source editor provides the usual features of Eclipse-based text editors,
        such as syntax highlighting, clipboard cut/copy/paste, unlimited undo/redo, folding,
        find/replace and incremental search.
      </para>

      <para> The IDE scans and indexes the C++ files in your project in the background, and provides
        navigation and code analysis features on top of that knowledge; this database
        is kept up to date as you edit the source.

        <title>Refactoring</title>
        <para>
            Several refactoring operations are available, for example Rename (<keycap>Shift+Alt+R</keycap>).
        </para>
      </sect3>
      <note>
          Most features that depend on cross-references require the project to be indexed. The C/C++ index contains
          the locations of functions, classes, enums, defines etc. from the whole project and referenced projects.
          The CDT does not keep the index up to date fully automatically, and occasionally you may need to
          manually request rebuilding or updating it. You can do so in the ``Index'' submenu of the project context menu.

    <title>Building the Project</title>
    <sect2>
        <title>Basics</title>
        <para>Once you have created your source files and configured your project settings, you can build the
        project by selecting ``Build Project'' from the ``Project'' menu or from the project context menu.
        You can also press <keycap>Ctrl+B</keycap> to build all open projects in the workspace.
        <picture file="pictures/CPP-BuildProject.png">Building a project</picture>
        </para>

        <note>
        <para>
        You may notice that the initial build of the project starts after a (sometimes long)
        delay, which is spent on indexing the project. The index is CDT's database of
        the project's classes, functions, methods, variables, macros, etc.;
        features such as content assist, go to definition, class hierarchy and refactoring
        are all based on the index.
        </para>

        <para>
        It is important that the C++ index is up to date before the build, because the index is used
        by the IDE for dependency generation in the generated makefiles. (The input for dependencies
        is the list of active [[#include]]'s in the sources, and the IDE takes this information
        from the index.)
        </para>
        </note>

        <sect3>
          <title>Build Output</title>
          <para>The build output (standard output and standard error) is displayed in the ``Console View''
              as the build progresses. Errors and warnings parsed from the output are displayed in the
              ``Problems View''. Double-clicking a line in the ``Problems View'' will jump to the corresponding
              source line. Conversely, the ``Console View'' is more useful when you want to look
              at the build messages in their natural order (``Problems View'' is usually sorted),
              for example when you get a lot of build errors and you want to begin by looking at
              the first one.
          </para>
        </sect3>

        <sect3>
          <title>Makefile Generation</title>
          <para>When you start the build process, a makefile will be created or refreshed in each
             folder where makefile creation is configured. After that, make will be invoked with the [[all]]
             target in the folder configured as build root.
          </para>
        </sect3>
	<note>
	  During the build process, the makefile will print out only the names of the compiled files.
	  If you want to see the full command line used to compile each file, specify
	  [[V=1]] (verbose on) on the make command line. To add this option,
	  open ``Project Properties | C/C++ Build | Behavior (tab)'' and replace [[all]] with [[all V=1]]
	  on the ``Build'' target line.
	</note>

        <sect3>
          <title>Cleaning the Project</title>
          <para>To clean the project, choose ``Clean...'' from the ``Project'' menu, or ``Clean Project'' from the
             project context menu. This will invoke make with the [[clean]] target in the build root folder.
             Often you may want to use the ``Clean Local'' item from the project context menu instead
             of ``Clean Projects'', because it does not clean referenced projects (see next section).
          </para>
        </sect3>

        <sect3>
          <title>Referenced Projects and the Build Process</title>
          <para>When you start the build, the IDE will build the referenced projects first. When you clean
              the project, the IDE will also clean the referenced projects first. This is often inconvenient
              (especially if your project depends on a large third party project). To avoid cleaning the
              referenced projects, use ``Clean Local'' from the project context menu.
          </para>
        </sect3>

        <sect3>
          <title>Build Configurations</title>
          <para>
              A project is built using the active build configuration. A project may have several build
              configurations, where each configuration selects a compiler toolchain, debug or release mode,
              defines symbols, etc. To set the active build configuration, choose ``Build Configurations | Set Active''
              from the project context menu.

        <para>The ``Problems View'' contains the errors and warnings generated by the build process. You can
        browse the problem list and double-click any message to go to the problem location in the source file.
        NED file and INI file problems are also reported in this view along with C++ problems. The editors
        are annotated with these markers, too. Hover over an error marker in the editor window to get the
        corresponding message as a tooltip.</para>

        <para>The make invocation can be configured on ``C/C++ Build'' page of the ``Project Properties'' dialog.
        Most settings are already set correctly and do not need to be changed. One exception is the
        ``Use parallel build'' option on the ``Behavior'' tab that you may want to enable, especially
        if you have a multi-core computer.</para>

        <warning>
        Do not set the number of parallel jobs to be significantly higher than the number of CPU cores
        you have. In particular, never turn on the ``Optimal jobs number'' feature, as it will start
        an excessive number of processes and you will run out of physical memory!
        </warning>

        <title>Managing Build Configurations</title>

            under the ``Build Configurations'' submenu of the project context menu.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
        <title>Configuring the Project Build System</title>
        <para>&Omnetpp; uses makefiles to build the project. You can use a single makefile for
        the whole project, or a hiearchy of makefiles. Each makefile may be hand-written
        (i.e. provided by you), or generated automatically. The IDE provides several
        options for automatically created makefiles.
        </para>
        <para>The build system for an &Omnetpp; project can be configured on the
        ``&Omnetpp; | Makemake'' page of the ``Project Properties'' dialog.
        All settings you do in this page will affect all build configurations.
        <picture file="pictures/CPP-SourceFolder.png">Configuring Makefiles</picture>
        </para>

        <sect3><title>Folders and Makefiles</title>
            <para>The page displays the folder tree of the project. Using controls on
            the page (``Build'' group in the top-right corner), you can declare that
            a selected folder contains a hand-written (custom) makefile, or
            tell the IDE to generate a makefile for you. Generated makefiles will be
            automatically refreshed before each build.  If a makefile is configured
            for a folder, the makefile kind will be indicated with a small
            decoration on the folder icon.
            </para>

            <para>The build root folder is indicated with a small arrow. This is the
            folder in which the IDE's ``Build'' function will invoke the make command,
            so it should contain a makefile. It is expected that this makefile
            will build the whole project, so it is supposed to invoke all other makefiles,
            either directly or indirectly. By default, the build root folder is
            the project root.  This is usually fine, but if you really need to change
            the project build root, overwrite the ``Build location'' setting
            in the ``C/C++ Build'' page of the same dialog.
            </para>

            <note>
            All generated makefiles will be named [[Makefile]];
            custom makefiles are also expected to have this name.
            </note>
        </sect3>

        <sect3><title>Source Folders</title>
            <para>In addition to makefiles, you also need to specify where your C++ files are
            located (source folders). This is usually the [[src]] folder of the project,
            or, for small projects, the project root. It is also possible to exclude folders
            from a source folder. The controls on the right-bottom part of the dialog
            (``Source'' group) allow you to set up source folders and exclusions on
            the project. Source files that are outside source folders or are in an excluded
            folder will be ignored by both the IDE and the build process.
            </para>

            <note>
            Source folders and exclusions that you configure on this page actually
            modify the contents of the ``Source Location'' tab of the ``C++ General | Paths and Symbols''
            page of the project properties dialog; the changes will affect all build
            configurations.
            </note>

            Automatic include path works best when include file names are unique, which is usually so.
            In the case of collisions (two or more include files having the same name), include statements
            should be qualified with the names of include files' parent folder (or more levels of ancestor
            folders), otherwise the result will be unpredictable. For instance, if you have two header

            [[#include "ospf/Route.h"]] and [[#include "base/Route.h"]] (or [[#include "ip/base/Route.h"]]);
            do ``not'' use [[#include "Route.h"]] because it would be ambiguous.
            If the problematic file is located in the project root, use the form
            [[#include "../projectname/inc.h"]] to make it unique.

              If you want to build a DLL on Windows using the Microsoft Visual Studio Clang/C2 compiler,
              symbols you want to use from other code need to be explicitly exported from the DLL.
              Functions, variables and classes must be marked with [[__declspec(dllexport)]] when the DLL is
              compiled, and with [[__declspec(dllimport)]] when you reference them from external code.
              This is achieved by defining a macro which expands differently in the two cases. The &Omnetpp;
              convention is to name the macro [[FOO_API]], where ``FOO'' is your project's short name.
              The macro should be defined as follows:</para>
          <screen>
#if defined(FOO_EXPORT)
#  define FOO_API OPP_DLLEXPORT
#elif defined(FOO_IMPORT)
#  define FOO_API OPP_DLLIMPORT
#else
#  define FOO_API
#endif
          </screen>
          <para>and the above definition should be manually placed into a header file which is included

    <title>Project Features</title>

    <sect2>
      <title>Motivation</title>
      <para>
        Long compile times are often an inconvenience when working with large
        &Omnetpp;-based model frameworks like the INET Framework. The IDE feature
        named ``Project Features'' lets you reduce build times by excluding or
        disabling parts of the model framework that you do not use for your
        simulation study. For example, when you are working on mobile ad-hoc simulations in INET,
        you can disable compilation of the Ethernet model, the IPv6/MIPv6 code,
        MPLS models and other unrelated protocol models. The word ``feature'' refers
        to a piece of the project codebase that can be turned off as a whole.
      </para>
      <para>
        Additional benefits of project features include a less cluttered model palette
        in the NED editor, being able to exclude code that does not compile on your system,
        and enforcing cleaner separation of unrelated parts in the model framework.
      </para>
      <note>
        A similar effect could also achieved via breaking up the model framework (e.g. INET)
        into several smaller projects, but that would cause other kinds of inconveniences for
        model developers and users alike.

      <title>What is a Project Feature</title>
      <para>
        Features can be defined per project. As already mentioned, a feature is a piece of the
        project codebase that can be turned off as a whole, that is, excluded from the C++ sources
        (and thus from the build) and also from NED. Feature definitions are typically written
        and distributed by the author of the project; end users are only presented with the
        option of enabling/disabling those features. A feature definition contains:
      </para>

      <itemizedlist>

          ``Feature name,'' for example [["UDP"]] or [["Mobility examples"]].
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          ``Feature description.'' This is a few sentences of text describing what the feature
          is or does; for example [["Implementation of the UDP protocol"]].
        </listitem>
        <listitem>

          of the feature.

        <listitem>
          ``Required features.'' Some features may be built on top of others; for example, a HMIPv6
          protocol implementation relies on MIPv6, which in turn relies on IPv6. Thus, HMIPv6 can
          only be enabled if MIPv6 and IPv6 are enabled as well.

        <listitem>
          ``NED packages.'' This is a list of NED package names that identify the code that implements
          the feature. When you disable the feature, NED types defined in those packages and their
          subpackages will be excluded; also, C++ code in the folders that correspond to the packages
          (i.e. in the same folders as excluded NED files) will also be excluded.

        <listitem>
          ``Extra C++ source folders.'' If the feature contains C++ code that lives outside NED source
          folders (nontypical), those folders are listed here.
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          ``Compile options,'' for example [[-DWITH_IPv6]]. When the feature is enabled, the compiler
          options listed here are added to the compiler command line of all C++ files in the project.
          A typical use of this field is defining symbols ([[WITH_xxx]]] that allows you to write conditional code
          that only compiles when a given feature is enabled. Currently only the [[-D]] option
          (``define symbol'') is supported here.
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          ``Linker options.'' When the feature is enabled, the linker options listed here are added
          to the linker command line. A typical use of this field is linking with additional
          libraries that the feature's code requires, for example libavcodec.
          Currently only the [[-l]] option (``link with library'') is supported here.

      <title>The Project Features Dialog</title>
      <para>
        Features can be viewed, enabled and disabled on the ``Project Features'' page of the
        ``Project Properties'' dialog. The ``Project | Project Features...'' menu item
        is a direct shortcut to this property page.
      </para>
      <picture file="pictures/CPP-Features.png">The Project Features page</picture>
      <para>
        The central area of the dialog page lists the features defined for the project.
        Hovering the mouse over a list item will show the description and other fields
        of the feature in a tooltip window. Check an item to enable the feature, and uncheck
        to disable.
      </para>
      <para>
        When you enable a feature that requires other features to work, the dialog
        will ask for permission to enable the required features as well. Also, if you disable
        a feature that others depend on, they will be disabled, too.
      </para>
      <para>
        The ``Apply'', ``OK'' and ``Cancel'' buttons work as expected. ``Restore Defaults''
        restores the features to their initial state (see the ``Initially enabled'' attribute above).
      </para>
      <para>
        Above the list there is a notification area in the dialog. If the IDE detects that
        your project's configuration is inconsistent with the feature enablements, it will display
        a warning there, and offer a way to automatically fix the problems. Fixing means that
        the IDE will adjust the project's NED and C++ settings to make them consistent
        with the feature enablements. Such check is also performed just before build.
      </para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>What Happens When You Enable/Disable a Feature</title>
      <para>
        When you enable or disable a feature on the ``Project Features'' page, a number of project
        settings will be modified:
      </para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          NED package exclusions. This corresponds to the contents of the ``Excluded package subtrees''
          list on the ``NED Source Folders'' property page. When a feature is disabled,
          its NED packages will be excluded (added to the list), and vice versa.
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          C++ folder exclusions. This can be viewed/edited on the ``Makemake'' property page, and
          also on the ``Source Location'' tab of the ``C/C++ General > Paths and Symbols''
          property page.
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          Compile options. For example, if the feature defines preprocessor symbols ([[-DWITH_xxx]]),
          they will be displayed on the ``Symbols'' tab of the ``C/C++ General > Paths and Symbols''
          property page.
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          Linker options. For example, if the feature defines additional libraries to link with,
          they will be displayed on the ``Libraries'' tab of the ``C/C++ General > Paths and Symbols''
          property page.
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      <note>
        Feature enablements are saved into the workspace metadata, i.e. outside in the project directory.
        This also means that the current feature enablement state cannot be (easily) put under
        version control.
      </note>
      <note>
        When you enable or disable a feature, &Omnetpp; (as of version 4.2) will trigger
        a reindexing for the project.
        This is done because C++ sources in the project may contain [[#ifdef]]'s that use
        symbols defined by the changed features ([[WITH_xxx]] symbols), and CDT does not
        automatically detect that those source files need to be re-parsed because of the changed
        conditions. Its is important for the &Omnetpp; IDE that the C++ index is up to date,
        because the index is used for dependency generation in generated makefiles.

    <sect2>
      <title>Using Features from Command Line</title>
      <para>
        ``Project Features'' can be easily configured from the IDE, but command line tools
        ([[opp_makemake]], etc.) can also use them with the help of the [[opp_featuretool]]
        command.
      </para>
      <para>
        If you want to build the project from the command line with the same feature
        combination the IDE is using, you need to generate the makefiles with the same [[opp_makemake]]
        options that the IDE uses in that feature combination. The [[opp_featuretool makemakeargs]]
        command (executed in the project's root directory) will show all the required
        arguments that you need to specify for the  [[opp_makemake]] command to
        build the same output as the IDE. This allows you to keep the same
        features enabled no matter how you build your project.
      </para>
      <para>
        Alternatively, you can choose ``Export'' on the ``Makemake'' page, and copy/paste the
        options from the generated [[makemakefiles]] file. This method is
        not recommended, because you must redo it manually each time after changing
        the enablement state of a feature.
      </para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>The [[.oppfeatures]] File</title>
      <para>
        Project features are defined in the [[.oppfeatures]] file in your project's
        root directory. This is an XML file, and it currently has to be written by hand
        (there is no specialized editor for it).
      </para>

      <para>
        The root element is [[&lt;features&gt;]], and it may have several [[&lt;feature&gt;]]
        child elements, each defining a project feature. The fields of a feature
        are represented with XML attributes; attribute names are [[id]], [[name]],
        [[description]], [[initiallyEnabled]], [[requires]], [[labels]], [[nedPackages]],
        [[extraSourceFolders]], [[compileFlags]] and [[linkerFlags]]. Items within attributes
        that represent lists ([[requires]], [[labels]], etc.) are separated by spaces.
      </para>

      <para>
        Here is an example feature from the INET Framework:
      </para>

<screen><![CDATA[
<feature
        id="TCP_common"
        name="TCP Common"
        description = "The common part of TCP implementations"
        initiallyEnabled = "true"
        requires = ""
        labels = ""
        nedPackages = "
                       inet.transport.tcp_common
                       inet.applications.tcpapp
                       inet.util.headerserializers.tcp
                      "
        extraSourceFolders = ""
        compileFlags = "-DWITH_TCP_COMMON"
        linkerFlags = ""
        />

      <title>How to Introduce a Project Feature</title>
      <para>
        If you plan to introduce a project feature in your project, here's what you'll need
        to do:
      </para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          Isolate the code that implements the feature into a separate source directory
          (or several directories). This is because only whole folders can be
          declared as part of a feature, individual source files cannot.
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          Check the remainder of the project. If you find source lines that reference
          code from the new feature, use conditional compilation ([[#ifdef WITH_YOURFEATURE]])
          to make sure that code compiles (and either works sensibly or throws an error)
          when the new feature is disabled. (Your feature should define the [[WITH_YOURFEATURE]]
          symbol, i.e. [[-DWITH_YOURFEATURE]] will need to be added to the feature compile flags.)
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          Add the feature description into the [[.oppfeatures]] file of your project.
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          Test. A rudimentary test can be verify that your project compiles at all, both
          with the new feature enabled and disabled. For such build tests, the
          ``Export build tester makefile'' function (at the bottom of the ``Project Features''
          property page) can be quite useful: it creates a makefile that builds the
          project in typical feature combinations. (It does not test ``2^N'' combinations because
          that's usually prohibitive, only about ``2*N+2''.)

    <title>Project Files</title>
    <para>
      Eclipse, CDT and the &Omnetpp; IDE uses several files in the project to store settings.
      These files are located in the project root directory, and they are normally
      hidden by the IDE in the ``Project Explorer View''. The files include:
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        [[.project]] : Eclipse stores the general project properties in this file including project name,
        dependencies from other projects, and project type (i.e. whether &Omnetpp;-specific
        features are supported or this is only a generic Eclipse project).
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        [[.cproject]] : This file contains settings specific to C++ development, including
        the build configurations; and per-configuration settings such as source folder locations
        and exclusions, include paths, linker paths, symbols; the build command, error parsers,
        debugger settings and so on.
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        [[.oppbuildspec]] : Contains settings specific to &Omnetpp;.
        This file stores per-folder makefile generation settings that can be configured
        on the ``Makemake'' page of the ``Project Properties'' dialog.
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        [[.nedfolders]] : Contains the names of NED source folders, and also package exclusions;
        this is the information that can be configured on the ``NED Source Folders'' page
        of the ``Project Properties'' dialog.
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>
      If you are creating a project where no C++ support is needed (i.e. you are using an existing
      precompiled simulation library and you edit only NED and Ini files), the [[.cproject]] and
      [[.oppbuildspec]] files will not be present in your project.
