    <title>Running a Simulation</title>
    <para> In previous versions of &Omnetpp;, executing a simulation or carrying out
      experiments was done by manually launching the executable file from the windowing
      environment or from a command line shell. Experiments that needed several runs with
      different parameters required external scripts to be written and executed. The new
      version of the &Omnetpp; IDE allows for running simulations and simulation batches
      directly from the IDE. </para>
    <sect2>
      <title>Creating launch configuration</title>
      <para> &Omnetpp; IDE adds a new Eclipse launch configuration type that supports
        launching simulation executables. This launch type, &Omnetpp; Simulation, is
        available from the Run Configurations dialog. To create a new run configuration,
        select Run Configurations... from the Run menu. A dialog appears, with the
        possible launch types on the left. Select &Omnetpp; Simulation, click the New launch
        configuration icon, then enter a configuration name at the top of the dialog form
        that appears. </para>
      <picture file="pictures/Launch-RunDialog.png">The Simulation Launcher</picture>
      <para> The main tab of the configuration dialog was designed to make the launching
        of simulation as easy as possible. The only required field is the Working
        directory, all others have defaults. If you only select the working directory and
        the simulation program, it will start "Run 0" of the first configuration from the
        omnetpp.ini file in the specified working directory. </para>
      <tip> Hover your mouse above the controls in this dialog and you will receive
        tooltip help for the particular control. </tip>
      <note> The Launch dialog will try to figure out your initial settings automatically.
        If you select an Ini file in the Project Explorer view, or the active editor
        contains an Ini file before launching the Run dialog, the Ini file and Working
        directory field will be automatically populated for you. The dialog will try to
        guess the executable name based on the settings of your current open projects.

          <para> Working directory: set it to your working directory. Several of the below
            entries are treated as relative to this directory. Changing the working

            <guibutton>Browse...</guibutton>
            button to select the executable directly. If your project output is a shared
            library, select "opp_run". The launcher dialog will use the "opp_run" helper
            executable to launch your simulation in the shared library. Check whether the
            "Dynamic Libraries" field in the advanced section contains the libraries you
            want to load.

            description of that section and the info that which Config section is extended
            by this section. You may select which Configuration should be launched.
            <note> The working directory and the Ini file must contain valid entries

          <para> Run number: It is possible to specify which run number(s) must be
            executed for the simulation. If the executable name and the Ini file was
            already selected, it is possible to hover above the field to get more info
            about the possible run numbers. You can use comma and .. to separate the run
            numbers; for example, 1,2,5..9,20 corresponds to run numbers 1,2,5,6,7,8,9,20.
            Entering a single asterisk (*) corresponds to all run numbers. Running several
            simulations in this manner is called batch execution. If you do not specify
            anything here, Run 0 will be executed. </para>
          <note> Batch execution is possible only if you run your program in command line
            environment. (simulation was built to support command line environment
            (Cmdenv) and the User interface selection is 'Command line'. (see User

          <para>Processes to run in parallel: with batch execution, it is
            possible to tell the launcher to keep two or more simulations running at a
            time. This way you can take advantage of multiple CPUs or CPU cores. </para>
          <note>This is usually an easier and more efficient way to exploit
            multiprocessing power than parallel simulation (PDES). </note>
          <warning> Use this option carefully, only if your simulation is CPU-limited, and
            you have enough physical RAM to support all of the processes at the same time.
            Do not set it higher than the number of physical processors you have in your

            during execution, currently command line (Cmdenv) and Tcl/Tk (Tkenv) is
            supported. The executable must be linked with the correct UI library or the UI
            should be loaded dynamically. </para>

            button is available to select one or more files (use
            <keycap>CTRL</keycap>
            click for multiple selection). This option can be used to load simulation code
            (i.e. simple modules), user interface libraries, or other extension libraries
            (scheduler, output file managers, etc). The special macro
            "${opp_shared_libs:/workingdir}" expands to all shared libraries provided by
            the current project or any other project we are currently depend on.
          </para>
          <note>If your simulation is built as a shared library, you must use the
            "opp_run" stub executable to start it. opp_run is basically an empty &Omnetpp;
            executable which understands all command line option, but does not contain any
            simulation code.</note>
          <warning>If you use external shared libraries (i.e. libraries other than the
            ones provided by the current open projects or &Omnetpp; itself), you must ensure
            that the executable part has access to the shared library. On Windows you must
            set the PATH, on Linux and Mac you must set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to
            the directory where the DLLs or shared libraries are located. You can set
            these variables either globally or in the Environment tab in the Launcher

    <title>Batch Execution</title>
    <para>
      In previous versions of &Omnetpp; to run a simulation several times with different
      parameters, you had to create an external script that created an Ini file for each
      run and started the simulation with the specified file. In &Omnetpp; 4.0 it is no
      longer needed. The vastly improved Ini file syntax allows you to specify loops for
      specific parameters so you no longer need separate Ini files for each run. In
      addition the IDE itself supports starting your simulation several times.
    </para>

      Iteration variable in the Ini file
    </picture>
    <note>Batch running is supported only in command line environment.</note>
    <para>
      If you create a Configuration with one or more iteration variables, you will be able
      to run your simulations using each possible value of these variables. Practically
      the IDE creates the cartesian product from these variables and assigns a run number
      to each product. It is possible to execute one, more or all runs of the simulation
      by specifying the
      <literal>Run number</literal>
      field in the Run Dialog. You can specify a single number (e.g. 3), and a combination
      of more numbers (e.g. 2,3,6,7..11) or all run numbers (using *).
    </para>
    <tip>
      If you already have specified your executable, the configuration which should be
      run and selected the Command line environment, you may try to hover over the
      <literal>Run Number</literal>
      field. This will give you a description of the possible runs and how they are
      associated with the iteration variable values.

    <para>
      If you have a multi-core or multi-processor system and have ample of memory, you may
      try to set the
      <literal>Processes to run parallel</literal>
      field to a higher number. This will allow the IDE to start more simulation process
      in parallel resulting in a much lower overall simulation time for the whole batch.
    </para>
    <warning>
      Be aware that you need enough memory to run all these processes in parallel. We
      recommend to use this feature only if your simulation is CPU bound. If you do not
      have enough memory your operating system may start to use virtual memory
      dramatically decreasing the overall performance.

    <title>Debugging a Simulation</title>
    <para>
      The &Omnetpp; IDE integrates with the CDT (C/C++ Development Tooling) of Eclipse. If you want to
      debug your application you have to do it by starting it from the
      <guimenuitem>Run|Debug Configurations</guimenuitem>
      . You should launch your debugging session exactly the same way you were running it.
    </para>
    <note>
      If you have problems with starting the debug session check whether:
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>your executable is built with debug info</listitem>
        <listitem>
          you can run the same executable without problem (using the same launch
          configuration)

    </note>
    <warning>
      Batch (and parallel) execution is not possible in this launch type, so you may
      specify only a single run number.

    <title>Launching Shortcuts</title>
    <para>While the Launch dialog is very powerful, in most cases you just want to run your
    simulation as quick as possible. Based on the current selection the IDE provides several
    quick methods to create a launch configuration. You can select a file by either clicking on
    it in the Project Explorer, or simply by opening it for editing. After selection, just click on the
    <guibutton>Run</guibutton> or <guibutton>Debug</guibutton> icon on the toolbar, or right click on
    the file and choose the <guimenuitem>Run As...</guimenuitem> or <guimenuitem>Debug As...</guimenuitem>
    menu.</para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>If a directory is selected and contains a single Ini file, the IDE will use
        this file to start the simulation.</listitem>
        <listitem>If an Ini file is selected it will be used during the launch as the main Ini file
        for the simulation.</listitem>
        <listitem>If a Ned file is selected which contains a network definition, the IDE will
        scan for Ini files in the active projects and will try to find a configuration allowing
        to start this network.</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    <note>
      If the information to launch the simulation is insufficient or ambiguous the IDE will ask you
      before creating a configuration.

    <title>Controlling the execution and progress reporting</title>
    <para>
      After starting a simulation process or simulation batch we can keep track of the
      started processes in the Debug View. To open the Debug View automatically during
      launch, check the Show Debug View on Launch in the run configuration dialog, or
      select
      <guimenuitem>Window / Show View... / Other... / Debug / Debug</guimenuitem>
      . Select a process and click the terminate button to stop a specific simulation run
      or use the context menu for more options to control the process execution.  
    </para>
    <picture file="pictures/Launch-DebugView.png">Debug View</picture>
    <tip>
      Place the debug view to a different tab group than the console so you will be able
      to switch between the process outputs and see the process list at the same time.
    </tip>
    <note>
      You can terminate all currently running processes by selecting the root of the
      launch. This will not cancel the whole batch only the currently active processes. If
      you want to cancel the whole batch, open the Progress View and cancel the simulation
      batch there.
    </note>
    <para>
      Clicking on the process in the Debug View switches to the output of that process in
      the Console view. The process may ask user input via the console too. Switch to the
      appropriate console and enter the requested paameters.

    <note>
      By default the Console View automatically activates when a process is writing to it.
      If you are running several processes in parallel this might be an annoying behavior
      and might prevent you to switch to the Progress View. You can switch off the auto
      activation by disabling the
      <guibutton>Show Console When Standard Out/Error Changes</guibutton>
      in the Console View toolbar.

    <title>Progress reporting</title>
      <para>
        If you have executed the simulation in the command line environment, you can
        monitor the progress of the simulation in the Progress View. See the status line
        for the overall progress indicator and click on it to open the detailed progress
        view. It is possible to terminate the whole batch by clicking on the cancel button
        in the Progress View.

        When Progress View displays "Waiting for user input" the simulation is waiting for
        the user. Switch to the appropriate console and provide the requested input for
        the simulation.
      </note>
      <note>
        By default cmdenv reports progress only on every 100000th event. If you feel that
        the progress should be more often reported set the
        <literal>cmdenv-status-frequency</literal>
        option in your Ini file to a lower value.
