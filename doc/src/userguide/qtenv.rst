The Qtenv Graphical Runtime Environment
=======================================

Qtenv is a graphical runtime interface for simulations. It supports interactive simulation execution, animation,
inspection, tracing, and debugging. In addition to model development and verification, Qtenv is also useful for
presentation and educational purposes, as it allows users to obtain a detailed picture of the simulation's state and history
at any point during execution.

Overview of the User Interface
------------------------------

.. figure:: pictures/Qtenv-main.png
   :width: 80%

   The main window of Qtenv

The top of the window contains the following elements below the menu bar:

-  :guilabel:`Toolbar`: The toolbar provides access to the most frequently used functions, such as stepping, running, and
   stopping the simulation.
-  :guilabel:`Animation speed`: The slider at the end of the toolbar allows you to adjust the speed of both built-in
   animations and the playback speed of custom animations added by the model.
-  :guilabel:`Event Number and Simulation Time`: These two labels at the right end of the toolbar display the event
   number of the last executed or next future event, and the current simulation time. You can change the display format
   from the context menu.
-  :guilabel:`Top status bar`: Three labels in a row that display either information about the next simulation event (in
   :guilabel:`Step` and :guilabel:`Normal` mode), or performance data such as the number of events processed per second (in
   :guilabel:`Fast` and :guilabel:`Express` mode). This bar can be hidden to free up vertical space.
-  :guilabel:`Timeline`: Displays the contents of the Future Events Set (FES) on a logarithmic time scale. The timeline
   can be toggled off to free up vertical space.
-  :guilabel:`Bottom status bar`: Displays the current configuration, run number, and root module (network) name on the left,
   along with statistics about message objects in the model on the right.

The central area of the main window is divided into these regions:

-  :guilabel:`Object Navigator`: Displays the hierarchy of objects in the current simulation and in the FES.
-  :guilabel:`Object Inspector`: Displays the contents and properties of the selected object.
-  :guilabel:`Network Display`: Displays the network or any module graphically. This is also where animation takes
   place.
-  :guilabel:`Log Viewer`: Displays the log of packets or messages sent between modules, or log messages output by
   modules during simulation.

Additionally, you can open inspector windows that float on top of the main window.

.. note::

   If you experience visual issues such as problematic colors that hinder using Qtenv, you can disable the platform integration style
   plugins of Qt by setting the ``QT_STYLE_OVERRIDE`` environment variable to ``fusion``. This makes widgets appear in a
   platform-independent manner. For example, on Linux systems with certain desktop environments, you might encounter a
   white-on-white color scheme; setting ``QT_STYLE_OVERRIDE`` to ``fusion`` will change the colors to a light gray
   background with dark gray text.

Parts of the Qtenv UI
---------------------

This section describes in detail the various parts of the Qtenv UI and how they function.

The Status Bars
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The status bars show the simulation's progress. There is one row at the top of the main window and one at the bottom.
You can hide the top one using the :menuselection:`View --> Status Details` menu item.

.. figure:: pictures/Qtenv-statusbar.png
   :width: 90%

   The top status bar

When the simulation is paused or running with animation, the top row displays the next expected simulation event. Note the
word :guilabel:`expected`. Certain schedulers may insert new events before the displayed event at the last moment. Schedulers
that typically do this include those accepting input from outside sources: real-time schedulers, hybrid or
hardware-in-the-loop schedulers, parallel simulation schedulers, etc. The top row contains:

1. Name, C++ class, and ID of the next message (event) object
2. The module where the next event will occur (i.e., the module where the message will be delivered)
3. The simulation time of the next (expected) simulation event
4. Time of the next event, and delta from the current simulation time

When the simulation runs in :guilabel:`Fast` or :guilabel:`Express` mode, displaying the next event becomes
impractical. The contents of the top row are replaced by these performance gauges:

.. figure:: pictures/Qtenv-statusbar-running.png
   :width: 90%

   The top status bar during Fast or Express run

1. Simulation speed: number of events processed per real second
2. Relative speed of the simulation (compared to real-time)
3. Event density: the number of events per simulated second

The bottom row contains these items:

.. figure:: pictures/Qtenv-statusbar-bottom.png
   :width: 90%

   The bottom status bar

1. Ini config name, run number, and the name of the network
2. Message statistics: the number of messages currently scheduled (i.e., in the FES); the number of message objects that
   currently exist in the simulation; and the total number of message objects created so far, including those already deleted.
   Of these three, the middle one is typically the most useful. If it steadily grows without apparent reason, the simulation model
   is likely missing some ``delete msg`` statements and requires debugging.

The Timeline
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: pictures/Qtenv-timeline.png
   :width: 90%

   The timeline

The timeline displays the Future Events Set contents on a logarithmic time scale. Each dot represents a message
(event). Messages scheduled for delivery at the current simulation time are grouped into a separate section on the left between
brackets.

Clicking an event will focus it in the :guilabel:`Object Inspector`, and double-clicking it will open a floating inspector
window. Right-clicking it will bring up a context menu with further actions.

The timeline is often crowded, limiting its usefulness. To address this, you can hide uninteresting events from the
timeline. Right-click an event and choose :guilabel:`Exclude Messages Like 'x' From Animation` from the context menu.
This hides events with a similar name and the same C++ class name from the timeline, and also skips animation when
such messages are sent between modules. You can view and edit the excluded messages list on the
:guilabel:`Filtering` page of the :guilabel:`Preferences` dialog. (Tip: the timeline context menu provides a shortcut to
this dialog).

You can hide or reveal the entire timeline using the :menuselection:`View --> Timeline` menu item, by pressing a
button on the toolbar, or simply by dragging the separator handle beneath it all the way up.

The Object Navigator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: pictures/Qtenv-objtree.png
   :width: 40%

   The object tree

The :guilabel:`Object Navigator` displays the hierarchy of objects in the current simulation and in the FES in tree form.

Clicking an object will focus it in the :guilabel:`Object Inspector`, and double-clicking it will open a floating inspector
window. Right-clicking it will bring up a context menu with further actions.

The Object Inspector
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :guilabel:`Object Inspector` is located below the :guilabel:`Object Navigator` and allows you to examine object contents
in detail. The :guilabel:`Object Inspector` always focuses on the object last clicked or selected in
the Qtenv UI. You can also navigate directly using the :guilabel:`Back`, :guilabel:`Forward`, and :guilabel:`Go to
Parent` buttons, or by double-clicking objects shown within the inspector's area.

.. list-table::

   * - .. figure:: pictures/Qtenv-inspector-grouped.png

          The object inspector in Grouped mode

     - .. figure:: pictures/Qtenv-inspector-flat.png
          :width: 80%

          The object inspector in Flat mode

The inspector offers four display modes: :guilabel:`Grouped`, :guilabel:`Flat`, :guilabel:`Children`, and
:guilabel:`Inheritance`. Switch between these modes using the buttons on the inspector's toolbar.

In :guilabel:`Grouped`, :guilabel:`Flat`, and :guilabel:`Inheritance` modes, the tree shows the object's fields (or data members).
It uses meta-information generated by the message compiler to obtain the field list and their values.
(This applies even to built-in classes â€” the simulation kernel contains their msg format descriptions.)

The difference between these three modes is how fields are arranged. In :guilabel:`Grouped` mode, they are
organized in categories; in :guilabel:`Flat` mode, they appear as a simple alphabetical list; and in :guilabel:`Inheritance`
mode, they are organized according to which superclass they are inherited from.

.. list-table::

   * - .. figure:: pictures/Qtenv-inspector-children.png
          :width: 80%

          The object inspector in Children mode

     - .. figure:: pictures/Qtenv-inspector-inheritance.png
          :width: 80%

          The object inspector in Inheritance mode

In :guilabel:`Children` mode, the tree shows the child objects of the currently inspected object. The child list is
obtained via the object's ``forEachChild()`` method. This is very similar to how the :guilabel:`Object Navigator`
works, but can have an arbitrary root.

The Network Display
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The network view provides a graphical representation of the network and modules. The visualization is based on
display strings (``@display`` properties in the NED file). You can navigate into any compound module by double-clicking its
icon.

Message sending, method calls, and various other events are animated in the graphical view. You can customize these animations
in the :guilabel:`Animation` page of the :guilabel:`Preferences` dialog.

.. figure:: pictures/Qtenv-network.png
   :width: 80%

   The network display

The built-in ``cCanvas`` of the inspected object is rendered in this view alongside the module contents,
allowing custom annotations and animations to be overlaid. This canvas contains figures declared by the ``@figure``
properties in the module's NED source.

By selecting the :guilabel:`Show/Hide Canvas Layers` item in the inspected module's context menu, you can filter the
displayed figures based on their assigned tags.

.. figure:: pictures/Qtenv-figure-filter.png
   :width: 60%

   Figure filtering dialog

Since figures can have multiple tags, a two-step filtering mechanism provides comprehensive control. The
left side functions as a whitelist, while the right side serves as a blacklist. The example above would display only figures with the
"oval" tag, except those that also have the "green" tag.

If the inspected module has a built-in ``cOsgCanvas`` (and Qtenv is built with OSG support enabled), this inspector can
be switched to 3D display mode using the globe icon on its toolbar. In this mode, the 2D network and canvas
display is replaced by the scene encapsulated in the ``cOsgCanvas``.

.. figure:: pictures/Qtenv-osg.png
   :width: 80%

   The network display in 3D mode

The context menu of submodules provides further actions (see below).

   The Utilities submenu

Zooming and Panning
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can zoom the canvas in several ways, using both mouse and keyboard:

-  To zoom in around a specific point, double-click the canvas; use Shift + double-click to zoom out, or scroll while holding
   down Ctrl.

   You can also zoom around the viewport center using the magnifying glass buttons on the canvas toolbar.

-  For marquee zoom, drag a rectangle with the left mouse button while holding down Ctrl; cancel the
   operation with the right mouse button if needed.

-  Panning: move the mouse while holding down the left mouse button to reposition the canvas; this is often more
   comfortable than using scroll bars. You can also scroll in any direction using
   the mouse wheel or equivalent touchpad gestures.

The Log Viewer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When running the simulation, the :guilabel:`Log Viewer` allows you to review logs and message traffic from the simulation.

The :guilabel:`Log Viewer` offers two modes that you can toggle using the inspector's local toolbar:
:guilabel:`Messages` and :guilabel:`Log` mode.

- In :guilabel:`Messages` mode, the window displays messages/packets sent locally in tabular format. Only messages
  sent between submodules of the inspected module and messages sent out of or into the module are shown. View
  details about any message in the :guilabel:`Object Inspector` by clicking on it, and access additional functions through
  its context menu. The simulation model can contribute columns by defining message printers (see the C++ section in
  this chapter).

- In :guilabel:`Log` mode, the window displays log lines belonging to any module in the submodule tree of the
  inspected compound module. Logs are written by simulation modules using ``EV``, ``EV_INFO``, ``EV_DETAIL``, and other
  logging macros. Formatting via ANSI escape sequences is supported. Configure the log prefix using the
  :guilabel:`Preferences` dialog.

The embedded :guilabel:`Log Viewer` follows the module selection in the :guilabel:`Network Display`.

The :guilabel:`Log Viewer` provides useful tools including bookmarking, textual line filtering, and the :guilabel:`Set Sending
Time as Reference` option that allows you to set a reference time and display all other times as deltas
relative to it.

Logs are recorded only in Step, Run, and Fast Run modes. (Express mode achieves its speed by turning off such overhead
while active.)

Only output from the last N events is preserved (N being configurable in the :guilabel:`Preferences` dialog);
after this limit is reached, information from older events is discarded.

Note that you can also open additional :guilabel:`Log Viewers` as floating windows, allowing you to monitor logs
from several modules simultaneously. To open a log window, locate the module in the module tree or network display,
right-click it, and select :guilabel:`Open Component Log` from the context menu.

   :width: 80%

.. figure:: pictures/Qtenv-log-textual.png
   :width: 80%

You can filter the window content to include only messages from specific modules. Open the log window's context
menu and select :guilabel:`Filter Window Contents`.

.. figure:: pictures/Qtenv-log-filter.png
   :width: 50%

   The log filter dialog

General logging behavior, such as prefix format, can be configured in the :guilabel:`Preferences` dialog. The log
level for each module (and its descendants) can be set through its context menu.


Using Qtenv
-----------

Starting Qtenv
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When launching a simulation from the IDE, it starts with Qtenv by default. If it doesn't, you can
explicitly select Qtenv in the :guilabel:`Run` or :guilabel:`Debug` dialog.

Qtenv is also the default when starting the simulation from the command line. When necessary, you can force Qtenv by
adding the ``-u Qtenv`` switch to your command.

The complete list of command-line options, related environment variables, and configuration options can be found at the
end of this chapter.

Setting Up and Running the Simulation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On startup, Qtenv reads the ini file(s) specified on the command line (or ``omnetpp.ini`` if none is specified) and
automatically sets up the simulation described in them. If multiple simulation configurations exist, Qtenv will
ask which one you want to set up.

.. figure:: pictures/Qtenv-setup-dialog.png
   :width: 60%

   Setting Up a New Simulation

Once a simulation is set up (modules created and initialized), you can run it in various modes and
examine its state. You can restart the simulation at any time or set up a different simulation. If you quit Qtenv
before the simulation finishes (or attempt to restart it), Qtenv will ask whether to finalize the
simulation, which typically means saving summary statistics.

Functions for setting up a simulation are available in the :guilabel:`File` and :guilabel:`Simulate` menus,
with the most important ones accessible via toolbar icons and keyboard shortcuts.

Some of these functions are:

.. figure:: pictures/Qtenv-file-menu.png
   :width: 50%

   The File menu

Set up a Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This function lets you choose a configuration and run number from the ini file.

Open Primary Ini File
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Opens the first ini file in a text window for viewing.

.. figure:: pictures/Qtenv-simulate-menu.png
   :width: 50%

   The Simulate menu

Step
^^^^

:guilabel:`Step` executes a single simulation event from the front of the FES. The next event is always shown on
the status bar. The module where the next event will be delivered is highlighted with a red rectangle in the graphical
display.

Run (or Normal Run)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In :guilabel:`Run` mode, the simulation runs with all tracing aids enabled. Message animation is active, and simulation time is
interpolated if the model requested a non-zero animation speed. Inspector windows are continuously updated. Output
messages appear in the main window and module output windows. Stop the simulation using the
:guilabel:`Stop` button on the toolbar. You can fully interact with the user interface during simulation execution,
including opening inspectors.

.. note::

   If you find this mode too slow or distracting, you can disable animation features in the :guilabel:`Preferences`
   dialog.

Fast Run
^^^^^^^^

In :guilabel:`Fast` mode, message animation is disabled and inspectors are updated less frequently. Fast mode is
several times faster than Run mode; speed can increase by up to 10 times (or up to the configured event count).

Express Run
^^^^^^^^^^^

In :guilabel:`Express` mode, the simulation runs at approximately the same speed as with Cmdenv, with all tracing disabled. Module
logs are not recorded. The simulation can only be interacted with occasionally, minimizing the runtime overhead of the user
interface. UI updates can be completely disabled, requiring you to explicitly click the
:guilabel:`Update now` button to refresh inspectors.

Run Until
^^^^^^^^^

You can run the simulation until a specified simulation time, event number, or until a specific message is
delivered or canceled. This feature is particularly valuable during debugging sessions.
You can also right-click an event in the simulation timeline and select :guilabel:`Run until this
event` from the menu.

.. figure:: pictures/Qtenv-rununtil.png
   :width: 60%

   The Run Until dialog

Run Until Next Event
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can also run until an event occurs in a specified module. Browse for the module and select :guilabel:`Run
until next event in this module.` The simulation will stop when an event occurs in the selected module.

Conclude Simulation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This function finalizes the simulation by invoking the user-supplied ``finish()`` member functions on all module and
channel objects in the simulation. The typical implementation of ``finish()`` records summary statistics. The
simulation cannot be continued after this operation.

Rebuild Network
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Rebuilds the simulation by deleting the current network and setting it up again. Improperly written simulations may
crash when :guilabel:`Rebuild Network` is invoked, typically due to incorrectly implemented destructors in module
classes.

Inspecting Objects
------------------

Inspecting Simulation Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Inspectors
^^^^^^^^^^

The :guilabel:`Network Display`, :guilabel:`Log Viewer`, and :guilabel:`Object Inspector` in the main window
share common properties: they display various aspects (graphical view, log messages, fields or contents) of a
given object. These UI components are called :guilabel:`inspectors` in Qtenv.

The three inspectors mentioned above are built into the main window, but you can open additional ones as needed.
These new inspectors appear in floating windows above the main window, and you can have any number open simultaneously.

Inspectors come in various types. They can be graphical like the network view, textual like the log viewer, tree-based
like the object inspector, or something entirely different.

The screenshot below shows Qtenv with several inspectors open.

.. figure:: pictures/Qtenv-with-inspectors.png
   :width: 80%

   Qtenv with several floating inspectors open

.. note::

   Some window managers might disable/hide the close button of floating inspectors. If this happens, you can still close
   them with a keyboard shortcut (most commonly Alt+F4), or by right-clicking on the title bar and choosing the Close option
   from the menu that appears.

Opening Inspectors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Inspectors can be opened in various ways: by double-clicking an item in the :guilabel:`Object Navigator` or in other
inspectors; by selecting one of the :guilabel:`Open` menu items from the context menu of an object displayed in the
UI; or via the :guilabel:`Find/Inspect Objects` dialog (described later). Inspector-related menu items are available in the :guilabel:`Inspect` menu.

.. figure:: pictures/Qtenv-inspect-menu.png
   :width: 50%

   The Inspect menu

There is also an :guilabel:`Inspect by pointer` menu item, which allows you to directly enter the C++ pointer of an
object as a hexadecimal value. Beware that entering an invalid pointer will crash the simulation. Object addresses can
be obtained, for example, by using a debugger.

Navigation History
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Inspectors always show some aspect of one simulation object, but they can change which object they display. For example, in the
:guilabel:`Network View`, when you double-click a submodule that is itself a compound module, the view switches to
showing the internals of that module. Similarly, the :guilabel:`Object Inspector` always shows information about the object
last clicked in the UI. Inspectors maintain a navigable history: the :guilabel:`Back` and :guilabel:`Forward` functions navigate
to objects inspected before or after the currently displayed object. Objects deleted during simulation automatically
disappear from the history.

Restoring Inspectors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When you exit and restart a simulation program, Qtenv attempts to reopen the inspector windows that were previously open.
However, because object identity is not preserved across different runs of the same program, Qtenv relies on
the object's full path, class name, and object ID (if available) to locate and identify the object to be inspected. This
approach can occasionally result in misidentification of objects.

Preferences such as zoom level or open/closed state of tree nodes are usually maintained per object type (i.e., tied to
the C++ class of the inspected object).

Browsing the Registered Components
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: pictures/Qtenv-inspect-menu-full.png
   :width: 60%

   The Inspect menu

Registered components (NED Types, classes, functions, enums) can be displayed using the :menuselection:`Inspect --> Available
components` menu item. If an error message reports missing types or classes, you can check here whether the missing item
is actually available and registered correctly.

Querying Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :guilabel:`Find/Inspect Objects` dialog allows you to search the simulation for objects that meet specific criteria.
These criteria can include the object name, class name, field values, or a combination of these. Class
names must be fully qualified (i.e., they should include their namespace(s)), regardless of the related setting
in the :guilabel:`Preferences dialog`. Results are presented in a sortable table, and you can double-click any item
to inspect it.

Some possible use cases:

- Identifying bottlenecks in the network by examining all queues ordered by length (i.e., sorting
  the result table by the :guilabel:`Info` column)
- Finding nodes with the highest packet drop count. If drop counts are watched variables (see the ``WATCH()``
  macro), you can easily list and sort them.
- Finding modules that leak messages. If the live message count on the status bar keeps increasing, you can search for
  all message objects to identify where the leaked messages are accumulating.
- Easy access to specific data structures or objects, such as routing tables. You can search by name or class name and use
  the result list as a collection of shortcuts, eliminating the need to manually navigate the simulation's object tree.

.. figure:: pictures/Qtenv-find.png
   :width: 60%

   Using the Find/Inspect Objects dialog to find long queues

The dialog lets you specify the search root, as well as the name and class name of the objects to find. The latter
two parameters accept wildcard patterns.

Use the checkboxes in the dialog to select object categories of interest. When you select a category,
all objects of that type (and any derived types) will be included in the search. Alternatively, if you specify
an object class as a class filter expression, the search dialog will match only objects with that exact class name.
Objects of derived types will not be included in this case.

You can also provide a generic filter expression, which by default matches against the object's full path. Wildcards (``"?"``,
``"*"``) are supported. ``"{a-exz}"`` matches any character in the range ``"a"`` through ``"e"`` plus the characters
``"x"`` and ``"z"``. Match numbers using patterns like ``"*.job{128..191}"`` to find objects named
``"job128"``, ``"job129"``, through ``"job191"``. Patterns like ``"job{128..}"`` and ``"job{..191}"`` are also supported.
Combine patterns using ``AND``, ``OR``, ``NOT``, and parentheses. Lowercase versions of these keywords (``and``,
``or``, ``not``) are also accepted. Match other object fields, such as queue length or message kind, using
the syntax ``fieldname =~ pattern``. For patterns containing special characters or spaces, enclose them in
quotes. (HINT: In most cases, start your pattern with ``"*."`` to match objects anywhere in the
network!)

Examples:

- ``*.destAddr``: Matches all objects with the name ``"destAddr"`` (likely module parameters).
- ``*.node[8..10].*``: Matches anything inside module ``node[8]``, ``node[9]``, and ``node[10]``.
- ``className =~ omnetpp::cQueue AND NOT length =~ 0``: Matches non-empty queue objects.
- ``className =~ omnetpp::cQueue AND length =~ {10..}``: Matches queue objects with length greater than or equal to 10.
- ``kind =~ 3 OR kind =~ {7..9}``: Matches messages with message kind equal to 3, 7, 8, or 9 (only messages have a ``"kind"`` attribute).
- ``className =~ IP* AND *.data-*``: Matches objects whose class name starts with ``"IP"`` and name starts with ``"data-"``.
- ``NOT className =~ omnetpp::cMessage AND byteLength =~ {1500..}``: Matches messages whose class is not cMessage and byteLength is at least 1500 (only messages have a ``"byteLength"`` attribute).
- ``"TCP packet" OR "*.packet(15)"``: Quotation marks are needed when the pattern is a reserved word or contains whitespace or special characters.


Using Qtenv with a Debugger
---------------------------

You can use Qtenv in combination with a C++ debugger, which is particularly useful when developing new models.
Qtenv assists with debugging in several ways:

- By triggering debug traps (also known as debug breakpoints) at strategic places, allowing you to
  debug specific events or error conditions.

- By launching an external debugger and attaching it to the simulation process before executing a debug trap. Qtenv
  detects if a debugger is already attached and, if not, offers to launch and attach one.

- By displaying memory addresses of inspected objects, making it easier to examine them in a debugger.

What is a debug trap? A debug trap is a mechanism that pauses program execution at a specific point,
allowing developers to inspect the current program state, including variables, memory, and control flow. When
triggered, it causes the debugger to halt the program, providing an opportunity for detailed
analysis and debugging. This is particularly valuable for identifying and resolving runtime errors,
unexpected behavior, or logic flaws in code. Debug traps are implemented using techniques such as
inserting specific instructions like ``int3`` or ``SIGTRAP``, which debuggers recognize as
breakpoints. When no debugger is attached, a debug trap typically causes the program to abort.

.. note::

   Qtenv is a library that runs as part of the simulation program. Therefore, suspending the simulation program in a
   debugger will also freeze the GUI until execution resumes. Similarly, if the simulation crashes, it will terminate the entire
   process, including the Qtenv GUI.

The debugger command line that Qtenv runs can be specified in one of two ways:

- The ``OMNETPP_DEBUGGER_COMMAND`` environment variable.
- The ``debugger-attach-command`` configuration option.

The value of these options must be a string containing exactly one ``%u`` placeholder, which Qtenv will
replace with the process ID of the simulation.

Qtenv offers the following debugging-related actions:

Debug On Errors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This menu item toggles whether a debug breakpoint is executed when the simulation encounters a
runtime error. This setting corresponds to the ``debug-on-errors`` configuration option. The state of this menu item is
reset to the value of ``debug-on-errors`` whenever a new simulation starts.

Debug Next Event
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Performs one simulation event similar to :guilabel:`Step`, but executes a debugger trap just before entering the module's
event handling code (``handleMessage()`` or ``activity()``). This causes the debugger to stop the program at that point,
allowing you to examine state variables, single-step through code, and more. When you resume execution, Qtenv regains control and
becomes responsive again.

Debug Now
~~~~~~~~~

Triggers a debug trap immediately.


Recording the Simulation
------------------------

Recording an Event Log
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The |omnet++| simulation kernel allows you to record event-related information to a file, which you can later use to
analyze the simulation run with the :guilabel:`Sequence Chart` tool in the IDE. Enable eventlog recording
with the ``record-eventlog=true`` ini file option, or interactively via the corresponding item in the
:guilabel:`Simulate` menu or using a toolbar button.

Note that starting Qtenv with ``record-eventlog=true`` produces a different eventlog file than enabling recording later.
In the former case, all network setup steps, including module creation, are recorded as
they occur. In the latter case, Qtenv must "fake" a sequence of steps that would produce the current simulation state.

Capturing a Video
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When active, this feature saves the main window contents to a subfolder named ``frames`` in the working
directory at regular intervals (in animation time). Each frame is saved as a PNG image with a sequential number in its file
name. You must then convert (encode) these images into a video file using an external tool
(such as ``ffmpeg``, ``avconv``, or ``vlc``). When recording begins, an info dialog appears showing
details about the output and providing an example command for high-quality encoding using ``ffmpeg``. The speed slider on the toolbar
also affects the resulting video.

.. note::

   This built-in recording feature produces smoother videos than external screen-capture utilities
   because it has access to more information and greater control over the process than external
   tools.

The Preferences Dialog
----------------------

Select :menuselection:`File --> Preferences` from the menu to open the runtime environment's configuration dialog.
This dialog allows you to customize various display, network layout, and animation options.

General
~~~~~~~

.. figure:: pictures/Qtenv-pref-general.png
   :width: 60%

   General settings

Use the :guilabel:`General` tab to configure default user interface behavior. You can specify whether namespaces
should be stripped from displayed class names and how frequently the user interface should update while the
simulation runs in :guilabel:`Express` mode.

Logs
~~~~

.. figure:: pictures/Qtenv-pref-logs.png
   :width: 60%

   Logging settings

Use the :guilabel:`Logs` tab to configure default logging behavior, including the log level for modules that don't
override it, the prefix format for event banners, and the size limit of the log buffer.

Configuring the Layouting Algorithm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Layouting settings

Qtenv automatically arranges submodules that don't have locations specified in their NED files. You can
fine-tune this layout algorithm on the :guilabel:`Layouting` page of this dialog.

Configuring Animation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Animation settings

Qtenv provides automatic animation during simulation runs. Fine-tune these animation settings using the
:guilabel:`Animation` page of the preferences dialog. If you don't need all the visual feedback that Qtenv provides,
you can selectively disable specific features:

- Animate messages: Enables/disables visualization of messages passing between modules.
- Broadcast animation: Provides special handling for message broadcasts (zero-time messages sent within the same event are
  animated concurrently).
- Show next event marker: Highlights the module that will receive the next event.
- Show a dotted arrow when a ``sendDirect()`` method call executes.
- Show a flashing arrow when a method call occurs between modules. The call is only animated if the called
  method contains the ``Enter_Method()`` macro.
- You can also disable the display of message names and classes.

Timeline and Animation Filtering
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Filtering

The :guilabel:`Filtering` page of the dialog serves two purposes. First, it lets you filter the contents of the
:guilabel:`Timeline`. You can hide all self-messages (timers) or all non-self messages. You can also
reduce the number of messages shown on the timeline by hiding non-animated messages, as explained below.

Second, you can suppress animation for specific message types. For example, when focusing on routing protocol
messages, you can suppress animation of data traffic messages.

The text box allows you to specify multiple filters, each on a separate line. Filter messages by
name, class name, or any other property that appears in the :guilabel:`Fields` page of the :guilabel:`Object Inspector`
when examining the message object.

.. note::

   When you select :guilabel:`Exclude Messages Like 'x' From Animation` from a message object's context menu,
   it automatically adds a new filter to this dialog page.

For object names, you can use wildcards (``"?"``, ``"*"``). ``"{a-exz}"`` matches any character in the range ``"a"``
through ``"e"`` plus the characters ``"x"`` and ``"z"``. Match numbers with patterns like ``"job{128..191}"`` to
match ``"job128"``, ``"job129"``, through ``"job191"``. Patterns like ``"job{128..}"`` and
``"job{..191}"`` are also supported. Combine patterns using ``AND``, ``OR``, ``NOT``, and parentheses. Lowercase versions of these
keywords (``and``, ``or``, ``not``) work as well. Match against other object fields, such as message
length or message kind, using the syntax ``fieldname =~ pattern``. Enclose patterns containing special characters or
spaces in quotes.

Examples:

- ``m*``: Matches any object whose name begins with "m".
- ``m* AND *-{0..250}``: Matches any object whose name begins with "m" and ends with a dash and a number between 0 and 250.
- ``NOT *timer*``: Matches any object whose name does not contain the substring "timer".
- ``NOT (*timer* OR *timeout*)``: Matches any object whose name contains neither "timer" nor "timeout".
- ``kind =~ 3 OR kind =~ {7..9}``: Matches messages with message kind equal to 3, 7, 8, or 9.
- ``className =~ IP* AND data-*``: Matches objects whose class name starts with "IP" and name starts with "data-".
- ``NOT className =~ omnetpp::cMessage AND byteLength =~ {1500..}``: Matches objects whose class is not cMessage and whose byteLength is at least 1500.
- ``"TCP packet" OR "*.packet(15)"``: Quotation marks are needed when the pattern is a reserved word or contains whitespace or special characters.

Models can also programmatically control animation through a per-module setting that prevents animations when
inspecting a specific module (``setBuiltinAnimationsAllowed()``).

Configuring Fonts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   :width: 60%

   Font selection

The :guilabel:`Fonts` page of the settings dialog lets you select the typeface and font size for different user
interface elements.

The .qtenvrc File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Settings are stored in ``.qtenvrc`` files. Two such files exist: one in the current directory containing
project-specific settings (such as the list of open inspectors), and another in the user's home directory
containing global settings.

.. note::

   Inspectors are identified by their object names. If multiple components share the same name (common with
   messages), you may see numerous inspector windows when starting the simulation. In
   such cases, simply delete the ``.qtenvrc`` file to resolve this issue.

Qtenv and C++
-------------

This section describes the C++ API functions that different parts of Qtenv use to display data and perform their functions.
Most of these are member functions of the ``cObject`` class.

Inspectors
~~~~~~~~~~

Inspectors display the hierarchical name (full path) and class name of the inspected object in the title using the
``getFullPath()`` and ``getClassName()`` member functions of ``cObject``. The :guilabel:`Go to parent` feature
uses the ``getOwner()`` method of ``cObject``.

The :guilabel:`Object Navigator` displays each object's full name and class name (using ``getFullName()`` and
``getClassName()``), plus the ID for classes that have one (``getId()`` on ``cMessage`` and ``cModule``). When
hovering over an object, the tooltip shows the info string (from the ``str()`` method). The tree roots are the network
module (``simulation.getSystemModule()``) and the FES (``simulation.getFES()``). Child objects are enumerated using
the ``forEachChild()`` method.

The :guilabel:`Object Inspector` in :guilabel:`Children` mode displays the full name, class name, and info string
(``getFullName()``, ``getClassName()``, ``str()``) of child objects enumerated using ``forEachChild()``.
``forEachChild()`` can only enumerate objects that are subclasses of ``cObject``. To make non-``cObject`` variables
(e.g., primitive types or STL containers) appear in the :guilabel:`Children` tree, you must wrap them in
``cObject``. The ``WATCH()`` macro does exactly this: it creates an object wrapper that displays the variable's value
via the wrapper's ``str()`` method. Special watch macros exist for STL containers; these present the wrapped object to
Qtenv in a more structured way using custom class descriptors (cClassDescriptor, see below).

One might wonder how the ``forEachChild()`` method of modules can enumerate messages, queues, and other objects owned by
the module. The module class maintains a list of owned objects, and ``cObject`` automatically joins
that list when created within the module's context.

The :guilabel:`Object Inspector` displays an object's fields using the class descriptor
(``cClassDescriptor``) for that class. Class descriptors are automatically generated for new classes by the message
compiler. Class descriptors for the |omnet++| library classes are also generated by the message compiler (see
``src/sim/sim_std.msg`` in the source tree).

The :guilabel:`Network Display` uses ``cSubmoduleIterator`` to enumerate submodules, and its :guilabel:`Go to parent
module` function uses ``getParentModule()``. Background and submodule rendering is based on display strings
(the ``getDisplayString()`` method of ``cComponent``).

Log Viewer
~~~~~~~~~~

The module log page of :guilabel:`Log Viewer` displays output from ``EV`` streams of modules and channels.
The log viewer supports basic formatting (including colors) via ANSI escape sequences.

The message/packet traffic page of :guilabel:`Log Viewer` shows information based on stored copies of sent messages (created
using ``dup()``) and stored sendhop information. The :guilabel:`Name` column displays the message name
(``getFullName()``). The :guilabel:`Info` column, however, does not display the string returned from ``str()``, but
instead shows strings produced by a ``cMessagePrinter`` object. Message printers can be dynamically registered to customize
this display.

During Simulation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Qtenv sets up a network by calling ``simulation.setupNetwork()``, then immediately invokes
``callInitialize()`` on the root module. During simulation, ``simulation.takeNextEvent()`` and
``simulation.executeEvent()`` are called iteratively. When the simulation ends, Qtenv invokes ``callFinish()`` on the
root module; this also happens when you select the :guilabel:`Conclude Simulation` menu item. The purpose of
``callFinish()`` is to record summary statistics at the end of a successful simulation run, so it's skipped if an
error occurs during simulation. Before setting up a new network or exiting, ``simulation.deleteNetwork()`` is called.

Animation
~~~~~~~~~

To refresh the visual representation of the simulation, Qtenv regularly invokes ``simulation.callRefreshDisplay()``,
which in turn calls the ``refreshDisplay()`` methods of modules and figures. These ``refreshDisplay()`` methods are
defined as part of the simulation model and typically update display strings and/or move, update, create, or
delete figures on module canvases.

``refreshDisplay()`` is invoked after each simulation event, or at a specific frame rate when smooth animation is
enabled. The frame rate during smooth simulation adapts dynamically. You can control various animation properties through
settings in the :guilabel:`Animation Parameters` dialog. For more information about smooth animation, see the corresponding
section in the Simulation Manual.

Extending Qtenv
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Users can contribute new inspector types without modifying Qtenv's source code. To do this, the inspector C++
code must include Qtenv header files and link with the Qtenv library. Note that Qtenv headers are not
considered public API and may change in future versions of |omnet++|.



Command-line and Configuration Options
--------------------------------------

Command-Line Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A simulation program built with Qtenv accepts these command-line switches:

- ``-h``: Prints a help message and exits.
- ``-u Qtenv``: Starts the program with Qtenv (this is the default, unless the program wasn't linked with
  Qtenv or has another custom environment library with higher priority).
- ``-f filename``: Specifies the configuration file name. The default is ``omnetpp.ini``. Multiple ``-f``
  switches can be used, allowing you to partition your configuration. For example, one file might contain
  general settings, another might contain most module parameters, and a third might contain frequently changed module
  parameters. The ``-f`` switch is optional.
- ``-l filename``: Loads a shared library (``.so`` file on Unix, ``.dll`` on Windows, and ``.dylib`` on macOS).
  Multiple ``-l`` switches are accepted. Shared libraries may contain simple modules and other code. File
  names can be specified without the file extension and the ``lib`` name prefix (e.g., ``foo`` instead of
  ``libfoo.so``).
- ``-n filepath``: Overrides the ``NEDPATH`` environment variable and sets the source locations for
  simulation NED files.
- ``-c configname``: Selects a specific INI configuration for execution.
- ``-r runnumber``: Has the same effect as (but takes priority over) the :guilabel:`qtenv-default-run=` INI file
  configuration option. Run filters are also accepted. When multiple runs match, they are grouped at the
  top of the selection combobox.

Environment Variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``OMNETPP_IMAGE_PATH``: Controls where Qtenv loads images for network graphics (modules, backgrounds, etc.). The
  value should be a semicolon-separated list of directories (on non-Windows systems, colons are also accepted as
  separators). The default is ``./bitmaps;./images;<omnetpp>/images``, meaning Qtenv searches the ``bitmaps``
  and ``images`` folders of the simulation, as well as the ``images`` folder in your installation's working directory.
  Directories are scanned recursively, with subdirectory names becoming part of the icon name. For example, if an
  ``images/`` directory is listed, the file ``images/misc/foo.png`` will be registered as an icon named ``misc/foo``.
  Qtenv supports PNG, JPG, and GIF files.
- ``OMNETPP_DEBUGGER_COMMAND``: When set, overrides the default command used to launch the
  just-in-time debugger (``debugger-attach-command``). It must contain '%u' (which will be replaced with the process
  ID of the simulation) and should not contain any additional '%' characters. Since the command needs to return
  immediately, on Linux and macOS systems, it's recommended to end it with an ampersand ('&'). Settings specified on the command line
  or in an ``.ini`` file take precedence over this environment variable.

Configuration Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Qtenv accepts these configuration options in the INI file:

- ``qtenv-extra-stack``: Specifies the extra stack space (in kilobytes) reserved for each ``activity()`` simple
  module when running the simulation under Qtenv. This value is significantly higher than the equivalent setting for Cmdenv
  because handling GUI events requires substantial stack space.
- ``qtenv-default-config``: Specifies which INI file configuration Qtenv should automatically set up at startup. If
  not specified, Qtenv will prompt you to select a configuration.
- ``qtenv-default-run``: Specifies which run of the selected configuration Qtenv should set up at startup. If
  not specified, Qtenv will prompt you to select a run.

All other settings can be adjusted through the GUI and are saved in ``.qtenvrc`` files.
