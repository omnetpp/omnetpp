  <title>A QUICK OVERVIEW OF THE &Omnetpp; IDE</title>
  <sect1>
    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>The &Omnetpp; Integrated Development Environment is based on the Eclipse platform, and extends
      it with new editors, views, wizards, and additional functionality. &Omnetpp; adds functionality for creating and
      configuring models (NED and ini files), performing batch executions, and analyzing simulation
      results, while Eclipse provides C++ editing, SVN/GIT integration, and other optional features (UML
      modeling, bugtracker integration, database access, etc.) via various open-source and commercial plug-ins.
    </para>
    <para>The following screenshots introduce the main components of the &Omnetpp; IDE.</para>
    <picture file="pictures/img1.png">The &Omnetpp; IDE, editing a NED file</picture>
  </sect1>
  <sect1>
    <title>The NED Editor</title>
    <para>The NED Editor can edit NED files both graphically or in text mode, and the user can switch
      between the two modes at any time, using the tabs at the bottom of the editor window.</para>
    <picture file="pictures/img2.png"> The NED Editor in graphical editing mode</picture>
    <para>In graphical mode, one can create compound modules, channels, and other component types.
      Submodules can be created using the palette of available module types. Visual and non-visual properties
      can be modified in the Properties View, or by dialogs invoked from the context menu. The editor offers
      many features such as unlimited undo/redo, object cloning, constrained move and resize, alignment of objects, and zooming.</para>
    <para>Submodules can be pinned (having a fixed position), or unpinned (auto-layout). Graphical
      features that can be edited are background image, background grid, default icons (via display string
      inheritance), icon sizing and coloring, transmission range, and many others.</para>
    <picture file="pictures/img3.png">Properties view</picture>
    <para>The Properties View lets the user edit graphical and non-graphical properties of objects. Special
      cell editors facilitate selecting colors, icons, etc. Undo and redo is supported for property changes
      too. The Properties View is also used with other editors like the Result Analysis editor, where it allows the user to
      customize charts and other objects.</para>
    <picture file="pictures/img4.png">The NED Editor in source editing mode</picture>
    <para>Text mode lets the user work with the NED source directly. When hitting Ctrl+Space, the editor
      offers context-aware completion of keywords and module type, parameter, gate, and submodule names.
      Template proposals to insert full compound module skeletons, submodules, various connection structures,
      etc. are also available. Documentation of referenced module types can be viewed by hovering over the NED
      type name. The NED source is continually parsed and validated as the user is typing, and errors are
      displayed in real time on the left margin. Syntax highlighting, automatic indentation, and automatic
      conversion from the &Omnetpp; 3.x NED syntax are also provided.</para>
    <picture file="pictures/img5.png">Outline View</picture>
    <para>The Outline View shows the structure of NED files in both graphical and text editing mode, and
      allows navigation, as well.</para>
    <para>
      <emphasis>Other Views.</emphasis>
      The Module Hierarchy View and the NED Parameters View can also be used with the NED Editor (they will
      display the submodule hierarchy and the parameters of the selected module or submodule) – these views
      will be described with the Ini File Editor. Further related views are the Problems View (which displays
      errors and warnings in NED files and other files), and Tasks View (which shows a list of all FIXME and
      TODO comments found in NED files and other source files.)
    </para>
  </sect1>
  <sect1>
    <title>The Ini File Editor</title>
    <para>The Ini File Editor lets the user configure simulation models for execution. It features both
      form-based and source editing.</para>
    <picture file="pictures/img6.png">Form-based ini file editing</picture>
    <para>The Ini File editor considers all supported configuration options and offers them in several
      forms, organized by topics. Descriptions and default values are displayed in tooltips, which can be made
      persistent for easier reading. The structure of the ini file (sections and their inheritance tree) is also
      visualized and editable via drag&amp;drop and dialogs. Validation and content assist
        (Ctrl+Space) are also provided where needed. The editor supports unlimited undo/redo and
         automatic conversion from &Omnetpp; 3.x ini files.</para>
    <picture file="pictures/img7.png">The ini file source editor</picture>
    <para>The text editor lets the user work with the ini file directly, which is more efficient for
      advanced users than forms. Unlimited undo/redo, syntax coloring, and completion of configuration keys, values,
      and module parameter patterns (on Ctrl+Space) are provided. As the user types, the file is continually
      analyzed and errors/warnings are displayed in real time.</para>
    <para>
      The editor considers all NED declarations (simple modules, compound modules, channels, etc.) and can
      fully exploit this information to provide diagnostics and assistance to the user. Looking at the 
      <emphasis>network=</emphasis>
      configuration key, it knows the top-level compound module NED type, and internally builds a static picture
      of the network by recursively enumerating the top-level module's submodules, sub-submodules,
      sub-sub-submodules, etc., and continually relates this information to the ini file contents. Thus, the
      editor always knows which ini file keys match which module parameters, which are the ini file keys that
      are unused (will not match anything), and which module parameters are still open (i.e. have no value assigned
      yet). It displays this information in tooltips, as warnings, and in various views.
    </para>
    <picture file="pictures/img8.png">The Add Missing Keys dialog</picture>
    <para>
      To speed up the process of creating ini files from scratch, the editor offers an
      <emphasis>Add Missing Keys</emphasis>
      dialog. After clicking OK, the editor will insert ini file keys for all open NED parameters. The user
      will only need to supply the values.
    </para>
    <picture file="pictures/img9.png">Module Hierarchy View</picture>
    <para>
      The Module Hierarchy View displays the submodule hierarchy of the current configuration's network,
      together with the module's parameters. It shows how module parameters obtain their values (from NED, by
      applying a NED default value, or from the ini file). It is able to resolve simple cases where a submodule
      type comes from a string parameter (NED's
      <emphasis>like</emphasis>
      keyword). By using the context menu, the user can go to the NED declaration of a module, submodule,
      parameter, gate, or to the place where a parameter gets its value (in NED or in the ini file).
    </para>
    <para>The View can be pinned to a particular editor to prevent its contents from changing when the user
      switches across NED and ini file editors.</para>
    <picture file="pictures/img10.png">The NED Parameters View</picture>
    <para>By default, the NED Parameters View displays the table of all unassigned NED parameters in the
      current configuration's network and it can be switched over to show all parameters, assigned or
      unassigned. For assigned parameters, it shows how they obtain their values (from NED, by applying a NED
      default value, or from the ini file). The user can open the relevant places in the NED files or the
      ini file. This View can also be pinned.</para>
    <picture file="pictures/img11.png">The Problems View</picture>
    <para>The Problems View presents errors, warnings, and info messages in NED files, ini files, and other
      source files in a unified manner. Double-clicking on an item opens the corresponding file and goes to the
      error's location. The view's contents can be filtered in various ways (current file, current project, all
      projects, by severity, etc).</para>
    <para>
      <emphasis>Other Views.</emphasis>
      The Outline View displays the list of sections in the current ini file and can be used for navigation as
      well.
    </para>
  </sect1>
  <sect1>
    <title>Simulation Launcher</title>
    <para>The &Omnetpp; IDE makes it possible to run simulations directly from the integrated environment. It
      is possible to run a simulation as a normal C/C++ application and perform C++ source-level debugging on
      it. The user can also run it as a standalone application (under Qtenv or Cmdenv) or  run batches of simulations
      where runs differ in module parameter settings or random number seeds (NOTE: an Eclipse-based runtime
      environment [“IDEEnv”] does not exist yet; it is planned for future releases).</para>
    <picture file="pictures/img12.png">The Run dialog showing a simulation launch
      configuration</picture>
    <para>
      In the Eclipse IDE, the various ways of launching a program under development is described by launch
      configurations. There are various launch configuration types (C/C++ Application, Java Application, etc.).
      To launch a program for the first time, the user creates an instance of a launch configuration, fills in
      a form (program name, command-line arguments, etc.), and hits the Run button. &Omnetpp; provides launch
      configuration types for simulations: one extends the normal “C/C++ Local Application” launch type with a
      <emphasis>Simulation</emphasis>
      tab (for convenient editing of simulation-related command-line options), and a standalone launch type
      for launching a simulation or running simulation batches. The former can be used for C++ debugging, as
      well.
    </para>
    <para>The dialog shows a standalone launch type for the QueueNet example simulation model. Batch
      simulations can be launched by specifying more than one run number in the dialog. Ini files 
       allow the user to define various scenarios iterating over a list of values for certain
      NED parameters, and/or do multiple runs with different seeds. The launch dialog helps the user select
      the desired run numbers by showing which runs correspond to which parameters and seed settings.</para>
    <para>Multi-processor or multi-core computers can be exploited by specifying that more than
      one process may be launched (i.e. may be running) at a time.</para>
    <picture file="pictures/img13.png">Progress View</picture>
    <para>The Progress View reports the status of simulation execution when you have a long-running
      simulation, or you are executing several runs in a batch. It is possible to cancel the whole batch
      operation with a single click, if necessary. Simulations run in separate processes
      that do not block the IDE, so users can keep working while their simulations run in the
      background. In the above screenshot, the number of processes to run in parallel was set to 2; run #1 has
      already terminated (and is no longer shown), run #3 has already launched, and run #2 is still
      running.</para>
    <picture file="pictures/img14.png">Console View</picture>
    <para>Each running process sends its output to a separate console buffer within the Console View, so
      the user can review the output after a simulation has finished. One can switch between console
      buffers using the Console View's menu or toolbar, or by double-clicking on a process in the Debug View.
    </para>
    <picture file="pictures/img15.png">The Debug View showing three runs in a
      simulation batch</picture>
    <para>The Debug View is another one of Eclipse's standard Views, but it is not only useful for
      debugging. While the Progress View only shows currently executing processes, the Debug View displays the
      ones already terminated, as well, together with their exit codes. Processes are marked with run
      numbers and launch times for easier identification. Double-clicking an item reveals the process output in
      the Console View.</para>
  </sect1>
  <sect1>
    <title>Sequence Chart</title>
    <para>The &Omnetpp; simulation kernel is capable of logging various events during simulation:
      scheduling and canceling self-messages, sending messages, display changes, module and connection
      creation and deletion, user log messages, etc. The result is an event log file which contains detailed
      information of the simulation, and later can be used for various purposes, such as visualizing message
      exchanges among modules on a sequence chart. The file format is line-based text to facilitate processing
      by third party tools.</para>
    <picture file="pictures/img16.png">A Sequence Chart showing ARP on a wireless network
    </picture>
    <para>An event log can be visualized with the Sequence Chart in the IDE. On the Sequence Chart, events
      are represented as nodes, and message send/schedule/reuse operations as arrows. The chart can be
      filtered according to modules, message types, and various other criteria. The chart can also be filtered according to the
      causes/consequences of a particular event (this works by following message arrows backward and forward
      in simulation time). The chart timeline can be displayed in various modes, such as linear (simulation
      time), compact (non-linear), and event number-based. Other features include sorting of module axes, displaying state vector
      data on axes (using output vector files), zooming, and special navigation options (bookmarks, zoom to
      message send, follow message send), and exporting the chart in SVG format.</para>
    <para>Both the Event Log Table and the Sequence Chart are capable of efficiently displaying event log
      files of several gigabytes without requiring large amounts of memory.</para>
    <picture file="pictures/img17.png">The Event Log View</picture>
    <para>The Event Log Table displays the content of an event log file recorded during a simulation. It
      supports raw and descriptive notations, line-based filtering for event log entry types and various
      parameters, search for free text, bookmarks, and special navigation options such as "go to simulation time"
      or message arrival. The Event Log Table supports the same filtering as the Sequence Chart.</para>
  </sect1>
  <sect1>
    <title>Scave (Result Analysis)</title>
    <para>Scave is the result analysis tool of &Omnetpp; and its task is to help the user process and
      visualize simulation results saved into vector and scalar files. Scave is designed so that the user can
      work equally well on the output of a single simulation run (one or two files) and the result of
      simulation batches (which may be several hundred files, possibly in multiple directories). Ad-hoc
      browsing of the data is supported in addition to systematic and repeatable processing. With the latter, 
      all processing and charts are stored as “recipes”. For example, if simulations need to be re-run
      due to a model bug or misconfiguration, existing charts do not need to be drawn all over again. Simply
      replacing the old result files with the new ones will result in the charts being automatically displayed
      with the new data.</para>
    <para>Scave is implemented as a multi-page editor. What the editor edits is the “recipe,” which includes what
      files to take as inputs, what data to select from them, what (optional) processing to apply, and what
      kind of charts to create from them. The pages (tabs) of the editor roughly correspond to these steps.
      You will see that Scave is much more than just a union of the &Omnetpp; 3.x Scalars and Plove tools.
    </para>
    <picture file="pictures/img18.png">Specifying input files for data analysis
    </picture>
    <para>The first page displays the result files that serve as input for the analysis. The upper half
      specifies what files to select, by explicit filenames or by wildcards. The lower half shows what files
      actually matched the input specification and what runs they contain. Note that &Omnetpp; result files
      contain a unique run ID and several metadata annotations in addition to the actual recorded data.  The
      third tree organizes simulation runs according to their experiment—measurement—replication labels.
    </para>
    <para>The underlying assumption is that users will organize their simulation-based research into
      various “experiments”. An experiment will consist of several “measurements”, which are typically (but
      not necessarily) simulations done with the same model but with different parameter settings; that is,
      the user will explore the parameter space with several simulation runs. To gain statistical
      confidence in the results, each measurement will be possibly repeated several times with different
      random number seeds. It is easy to set up such scenarios with the improved ini files of &Omnetpp;. 
     Then, the experiment-measurement-replication labels will be assigned more-or-less automatically – please
      refer to the Inifile document (“Configuring Simulations in &Omnetpp;”) for more discussion.</para>
    <picture file="pictures/img19.png">Browsing vector and scalar data generated
      by the simulation</picture>
    <para>
      The second page displays results (vectors, scalars, and histograms) from all files in tables and lets
      the user browse them. Results can be sorted and filtered. Simple filtering is possible with combo
      boxes, or when that is not enough, the user can write arbitrarily complex filters using a generic pattern
      matching expression language. Selected or filtered data can be immediately plotted, or remembered in
      named datasets
      <emphasis> for further processing</emphasis>
      .
    </para>
    <picture file="pictures/img20.png">Defining datasets to be analyzed</picture>
    <para>It is possible to define reusable datasets that are basically recipes
    on how to select and process data received from the simulation. You can add selection
    and data processing nodes to a dataset. Chart drawing is possible at any point in the
    processing tree.</para>
    <picture file="pictures/img21.png">A Line Chart</picture>
    <para>Line charts are typically drawn from time-series data stored in vector files. Pre-processing
    of the data is possible in the dataset. The line chart component can be configured freely to
    display the vector data according to your needs.</para>
    <picture file="pictures/img22.png">A Bar Chart</picture>
    <para>Bar charts are created from scalar results and histograms. Relevant data can be grouped and displayed
    via the Bar chart component. Colors, chart type, and other display attributes can be set on the component.</para>
    <picture file="pictures/img23.png">Output Vector View</picture>
    <para>The Output Vector View can be used to inspect the raw numerical data when required.
    It can show the original data read from the vector file, or the result of a computation. The user can select
    a point on the line chart or a vector in the Dataset View and its content will be displayed.</para>

    <picture file="pictures/img24.png">Dataset View</picture>
    <para>The Dataset View is used to show the result items contained in the dataset. The content of the
    view corresponds to the state of the dataset after the selected processing is performed.</para>
