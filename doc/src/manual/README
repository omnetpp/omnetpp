How to build the manual on Windows (on Linux it's easier)
=========================================================

Prerequisites
-------------
1. Install MiKTex from miktex.org. The "basic" package is enough.
   (pdflatex will download needed extra packages automatically when you
   first build the document).

2. Install Inkscape. It will be used for SVG editing as well as for
   SVG-to-PNG and SVG-to-PDF conversion.


Making HTML output
------------------
Type "make usman.html". It uses local perl scripts for the conversion.



Making PDF output
-----------------
Make sure that MiKTeX/miktext/bin is in the path, the type "make usman.pdf". 


Graphics
--------
See http://amath.colorado.edu/documentation/LaTeX/reference/figures.html

Screenshots and other raster images should be checked in as PNG, and included
in the LaTeX sources like this:

  \includegraphics[width=60mm]{myfig.png}
  \includegraphics[height=60mm]{myfig.jpg}
  \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{myfig.pdf}
  \includegraphics[angle=45,width=52mm]{myfig.jpg}

Vector graphics should be drawn and checked in in SVG format. This will be
rasterized to PNG and exported as vector PDF using Inkscape command-line
options:

  inkscape -e FILENAME  (or --export-png=FILENAME)
  inkscape -A FILENAME  (or --export-pdf=FILENAME)

See http://inkscape.modevia.com/inkscape-man.html for other options (e.g.
-w/-h for specifying bitmap dimensions in pixels).
