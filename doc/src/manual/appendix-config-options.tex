\item[**.bin-recording] = \textit{<bool>}, default: \ttt{true}\\
    \textit{Per-object setting for scalar results.}\\
    Whether the bins of the matching histogram object should be recorded,
    provided that recording of the histogram object itself is enabled
    (\ttt{**.{\allowbreak}<scalar-{\allowbreak}name>.{\allowbreak}scalar-{\allowbreak}recording={\allowbreak}true}).\\Usage:
    \ttt{<module-{\allowbreak}full-{\allowbreak}path>.{\allowbreak}<scalar-{\allowbreak}name>.{\allowbreak}bin-{\allowbreak}recording={\allowbreak}true/{\allowbreak}false}.
    To control histogram recording from a \ttt{@{\allowbreak}statistic}, use
    \ttt{<statistic-{\allowbreak}name>:{\allowbreak}histogram} for
    \ttt{<scalar-{\allowbreak}name>}.\\Example:
    \ttt{**.{\allowbreak}ping.{\allowbreak}round\-Trip\-Time:{\allowbreak}histogram.{\allowbreak}bin-{\allowbreak}recording={\allowbreak}false}
\item[check-signals] = \textit{<bool>}, default: \ttt{true}\\
    \textit{Per-simulation-run setting.}\\
    Controls whether the simulation kernel will validate signals emitted by
    modules and channels against signal declarations
    (\ttt{@{\allowbreak}signal} properties) in NED files. The default setting
    depends on the build type: \ttt{true} in DEBUG, and \ttt{false} in RELEASE
    mode.
\item[cmdenv-autoflush] = \textit{<bool>}, default: \ttt{false}\\
    \textit{Per-simulation-run setting.}\\
    Call \ttt{fflush(stdout)} after each event banner or status update; affects
    both express and normal mode. Turning on autoflush may have a performance
    penalty, but it can be useful with printf-style debugging for tracking down
    program crashes.
\item[cmdenv-config-name] = \textit{<string>}\\
    \textit{Global setting (applies to all simulation runs).}\\
    Specifies the name of the configuration to be run (for a value \ttt{Foo},
    section \ttt{[Config {\allowbreak}Foo]} will be used from the ini file).
    See also
    \ttt{cmdenv-{\allowbreak}runs-{\allowbreak}to-{\allowbreak}execute}. The
    \ttt{-{\allowbreak}c} command line option overrides this setting.
\item[cmdenv-event-banner-details] = \textit{<bool>}, default: \ttt{false}\\
    \textit{Per-simulation-run setting.}\\
    When
    \ttt{cmdenv-{\allowbreak}express-{\allowbreak}mode={\allowbreak}false}:
    print extra information after event banners.
\item[cmdenv-event-banners] = \textit{<bool>}, default: \ttt{true}\\
    \textit{Per-simulation-run setting.}\\
    When
    \ttt{cmdenv-{\allowbreak}express-{\allowbreak}mode={\allowbreak}false}:
    turns printing event banners on/off.
\item[cmdenv-express-mode] = \textit{<bool>}, default: \ttt{true}\\
    \textit{Per-simulation-run setting.}\\
    Selects normal (debug/trace) or express mode.
\item[cmdenv-extra-stack] = \textit{<double>}, unit=\ttt{B}, default: \ttt{8Ki\-B}\\
    \textit{Global setting (applies to all simulation runs).}\\
    Specifies the extra amount of stack that is reserved for each
    \ttt{activity()} simple module when the simulation is run under Cmdenv.
\item[cmdenv-interactive] = \textit{<bool>}, default: \ttt{false}\\
    \textit{Per-simulation-run setting.}\\
    Defines what Cmdenv should do when the model contains unassigned
    parameters. In interactive mode, it asks the user. In non-interactive mode
    (which is more suitable for batch execution), Cmdenv stops with an error.
\item[**.cmdenv-log-level] = \textit{<string>}, default: \ttt{TRACE}\\
    \textit{Per-object setting for modules.}\\
    Specifies the per-component level of detail recorded by log statements,
    output below the specified level is omitted. Available values are (case
    insensitive): \ttt{off}, \ttt{fatal}, \ttt{error}, \ttt{warn}, \ttt{info},
    \ttt{detail}, \ttt{debug} or \ttt{trace}. Note that the level of detail is
    also controlled by the globally specified runtime log level and the
    \ttt{COMPILETIME\_LOGLEVEL} macro that is used to completely remove log
    statements from the executable.
\item[cmdenv-log-prefix] = \textit{<string>}, default: \ttt{[\%l]	}\\
    \textit{Per-simulation-run setting.}\\
    Specifies the format string that determines the prefix of each log line.
    The format string may contain format directives in the syntax \ttt{\%x} (a
    \ttt{\%} followed by a single format character).  For example \ttt{\%l}
    stands for log level, and \ttt{\%J} for source component. See the manual
    for the list of available format characters.
\item[cmdenv-output-file] = \textit{<filename>}, default: \ttt{\$\{{\allowbreak}resultdir\}{\allowbreak}/{\allowbreak}\$\{{\allowbreak}configname\}{\allowbreak}-{\allowbreak}\$\{{\allowbreak}iterationvarsf\}{\allowbreak}\#\$\{{\allowbreak}repetition\}{\allowbreak}.{\allowbreak}out}\\
    \textit{Per-simulation-run setting.}\\
    When
    \ttt{cmdenv-{\allowbreak}record-{\allowbreak}output={\allowbreak}true}:
    file name to redirect standard output to. See also
    \ttt{fname-{\allowbreak}append-{\allowbreak}host}.
\item[cmdenv-performance-display] = \textit{<bool>}, default: \ttt{true}\\
    \textit{Per-simulation-run setting.}\\
    When \ttt{cmdenv-{\allowbreak}express-{\allowbreak}mode={\allowbreak}true}:
    print detailed performance information. Turning it on results in a 3-line
    entry printed on each update, containing ev/sec, simsec/sec, ev/simsec,
    number of messages created/still present/currently scheduled in FES.
\item[cmdenv-redirect-output] = \textit{<bool>}, default: \ttt{false}\\
    \textit{Per-simulation-run setting.}\\
    Causes Cmdenv to redirect standard output of simulation runs to a file or
    separate files per run. This option can be useful with running simulation
    campaigns (e.g. using opp\_runall), and also with parallel simulation. See
    also: \ttt{cmdenv-{\allowbreak}output-{\allowbreak}file},
    \ttt{fname-{\allowbreak}append-{\allowbreak}host}.
\item[cmdenv-runs-to-execute] = \textit{<string>}\\
    \textit{Global setting (applies to all simulation runs).}\\
    Specifies which runs to execute from the selected configuration (see
    \ttt{cmdenv-{\allowbreak}config-{\allowbreak}name} option). It accepts a
    filter expression of iteration variables such as \ttt{\$num\-Hosts>10
    {\allowbreak}\&\& {\allowbreak}\$iatime={\allowbreak}={\allowbreak}1s}, or
    a comma-separated list of run numbers or run number ranges, e.g.
    \ttt{1,{\allowbreak}3..{\allowbreak}4,{\allowbreak}7..{\allowbreak}9}. If
    the value is missing, Cmdenv executes all runs in the selected
    configuration. The \ttt{-{\allowbreak}r} command line option overrides this
    setting.
\item[cmdenv-status-frequency] = \textit{<double>}, unit=\ttt{s}, default: \ttt{2s}\\
    \textit{Per-simulation-run setting.}\\
    When \ttt{cmdenv-{\allowbreak}express-{\allowbreak}mode={\allowbreak}true}:
    print status update every n seconds.
\item[cmdenv-stop-batch-on-error] = \textit{<bool>}, default: \ttt{true}\\
    \textit{Per-simulation-run setting.}\\
    Decides whether Cmdenv should skip the rest of the runs when an error
    occurs during the execution of one run.
\item[configuration-class] = \textit{<string>}\\
    \textit{Global setting (applies to all simulation runs).}\\
    Part of the Envir plugin mechanism: selects the class from which all
    configuration information will be obtained. This option lets you replace
    omnetpp.ini with some other implementation, e.g. database input. The
    simulation program still has to bootstrap from an omnetpp.ini (which
    contains the configuration-class setting). The class should implement the
    \ttt{cConfiguration\-Ex} interface.
\item[constraint] = \textit{<string>}\\
    \textit{Per-simulation-run setting.}\\
    For scenarios. Contains an expression that iteration variables
    (\ttt{\$\{{\allowbreak}\}{\allowbreak}} syntax) must satisfy for that
    simulation to run. Example: \ttt{\$i {\allowbreak}< {\allowbreak}\$j+1}.
\item[cpu-time-limit] = \textit{<double>}, unit=\ttt{s}\\
    \textit{Per-simulation-run setting.}\\
    Stops the simulation when CPU usage has reached the given limit. The
    default is no limit. Note: To reduce per-event overhead, this time limit is
    only checked every N events (by default, N=1024).
\item[debug-on-errors] = \textit{<bool>}, default: \ttt{false}\\
    \textit{Global setting (applies to all simulation runs).}\\
    When set to true, runtime errors will cause the simulation program to break
    into the C++ debugger (if the simulation is running under one, or
    just-in-time debugging is activated). Once in the debugger, you can view
    the stack trace or examine variables.
\item[debug-statistics-recording] = \textit{<bool>}, default: \ttt{false}\\
    \textit{Per-simulation-run setting.}\\
    Turns on the printing of debugging information related to statistics
    recording (\ttt{@{\allowbreak}statistic} properties)
\item[debugger-attach-command] = \textit{<string>}, default: \ttt{nemiver {\allowbreak}-{\allowbreak}-{\allowbreak}attach={\allowbreak}\%u {\allowbreak}\&}\\
    \textit{Global setting (applies to all simulation runs).}\\
    Command line to launch the debugger. It must contain exactly one percent
    sign, as \ttt{\%u}, which will be replaced by the PID of this process. The
    command must not block (i.e. it should end in \ttt{\&} on Unix-like
    systems).
\item[debugger-attach-on-error] = \textit{<bool>}, default: \ttt{false}\\
    \textit{Global setting (applies to all simulation runs).}\\
    When set to true, runtime errors and crashes will trigger an external
    debugger to be launched, allowing you to perform just-in-time debugging on
    the simulation process. The debugger command is configurable. Note that
    debugging (i.e. attaching to) a non-child process needs to be explicitly
    enabled on some systems, e.g. Ubuntu.
\item[debugger-attach-on-startup] = \textit{<bool>}, default: \ttt{false}\\
    \textit{Global setting (applies to all simulation runs).}\\
    When set to true, the simulation program will launch an external debugger
    attached to it, allowing you to set breakpoints before proceeding. The
    debugger command is configurable.  Note that debugging (i.e. attaching to)
    a non-child process needs to be explicitly enabled on some systems, e.g.
    Ubuntu.
\item[debugger-attach-wait-time] = \textit{<double>}, unit=\ttt{s}, default: \ttt{20s}\\
    \textit{Global setting (applies to all simulation runs).}\\
    An interval to wait after launching the external debugger, to give the
    debugger time to start up and attach to the simulation process.
\item[description] = \textit{<string>}\\
    \textit{Per-simulation-run setting.}\\
    Descriptive name for the given simulation configuration. Descriptions get
    displayed in the run selection dialog.
\item[eventlog-file] = \textit{<filename>}, default: \ttt{\$\{{\allowbreak}resultdir\}{\allowbreak}/{\allowbreak}\$\{{\allowbreak}configname\}{\allowbreak}-{\allowbreak}\$\{{\allowbreak}iterationvarsf\}{\allowbreak}\#\$\{{\allowbreak}repetition\}{\allowbreak}.{\allowbreak}elog}\\
    \textit{Per-simulation-run setting.}\\
    Name of the eventlog file to generate.
\item[eventlog-message-detail-pattern] = \textit{<custom>}\\
    \textit{Per-simulation-run setting.}\\
    A list of patterns separated by '|' character which will be used to write
    message detail information into the eventlog for each message sent during
    the simulation. The message detail will be presented in the sequence chart
    tool. Each pattern starts with an object pattern optionally followed by ':'
    character and a comma separated list of field patterns. In both patterns
    and/or/not/* and various field match expressions can be used. The object
    pattern matches to class name, the field pattern matches to field name by
    default.\\

    all fields of all messages\\
    \ttt{*Frame:{\allowbreak}*Address,{\allowbreak}*Id}: captures all fields
    named somethingAddress and somethingId from messages of any class named
    somethingFrame\\  \ttt{My\-Message:{\allowbreak}declared\-On(My\-Message)}:
    captures instances of MyMessage recording the fields declared on the
    MyMessage class\\  \ttt{*:{\allowbreak}(not
    {\allowbreak}declared\-On(cMessage) {\allowbreak}and {\allowbreak}not
    {\allowbreak}declared\-On(cNamed\-Object) {\allowbreak}and {\allowbreak}not
    {\allowbreak}declared\-On(cObject))}: records user-defined fields from all
    messages
\item[eventlog-recording-intervals] = \textit{<custom>}\\
    \textit{Per-simulation-run setting.}\\
    Simulation time interval(s) when events should be recorded. Syntax:
    \ttt{[<from>]..{\allowbreak}[<to>],{\allowbreak}...{\allowbreak}} That is,
    both start and end of an interval are optional, and intervals are separated
    by comma. Example: \ttt{..{\allowbreak}10.{\allowbreak}2,{\allowbreak}
    {\allowbreak}22.{\allowbreak}2..{\allowbreak}100,{\allowbreak}
    {\allowbreak}233.{\allowbreak}3..{\allowbreak}}
\item[eventlogmanager-class] = \textit{<string>}, default: \ttt{omnetpp::{\allowbreak}envir::{\allowbreak}Eventlog\-File\-Manager}\\
    \textit{Global setting (applies to all simulation runs).}\\
    Part of the Envir plugin mechanism: selects the eventlog manager class to
    be used to record data. The class has to implement the
    \ttt{cIEventlog\-Manager} interface.
\item[experiment-label] = \textit{<string>}, default: \ttt{\$\{{\allowbreak}configname\}{\allowbreak}}\\
    \textit{Per-simulation-run setting.}\\
    Identifies the simulation experiment (which consists of several,
    potentially repeated measurements). This string gets recorded into result
    files, and may be referred to during result analysis.
\item[extends] = \textit{<string>}\\
    \textit{Per-simulation-run setting.}\\
    Name of the configuration this section is based on. Entries from that
    section will be inherited and can be overridden. In other words,
    configuration lookups will fall back to the base section.
\item[fingerprint] = \textit{<string>}\\
    \textit{Per-simulation-run setting.}\\
    The expected fingerprints of the simulation. If you need multiple
    fingerprints, separate them with commas. When provided, the fingerprints
    will be calculated from the specified properties of simulation events,
    messages, and statistics during execution, and checked against the provided
    values. Fingerprints are suitable for crude regression tests. As
    fingerprints occasionally differ across platforms, more than one value can
    be specified for a single fingerprint, separated by spaces, and a match
    with any of them will be accepted. To obtain a fingerprint, enter a dummy
    value (such as \ttt{0000}), and run the simulation.
\item[fingerprint-events] = \textit{<string>}, default: \ttt{*}\\
    \textit{Per-simulation-run setting.}\\
    Configures the fingerprint calculator to consider only certain events. The
    value is a pattern that will be matched against the event name by default.
    It may also be an expression containing pattern matching characters, field
    access, and logical operators. The default setting is '*' which includes
    all events in the calculated fingerprint. If you configured multiple
    fingerprints, separate filters with commas.
\item[fingerprint-ingredients] = \textit{<string>}, default: \ttt{tplx}\\
    \textit{Per-simulation-run setting.}\\
    Specifies the list of ingredients to be taken into account for fingerprint
    computation. Each character corresponds to one ingredient: 'e' event
    number, 't' simulation time, 'n' message (event) full name, 'c' message
    (event) class name, 'k' message kind, 'l' message bit length, 'o' message
    control info class name, 'd' message data, 'i' module id, 'm' module full
    name, 'p' module full path, 'a' module class name, 'r' random numbers
    drawn, 's' scalar results, 'z' statistic results, 'v' vector results, 'x'
    extra data provided by modules. Note: ingredients specified in an expected
    fingerprint (characters after the '/' in the fingerprint value) take
    precedence over this setting. If you configured multiple fingerprints,
    separate ingredients with commas.
\item[fingerprint-modules] = \textit{<string>}, default: \ttt{*}\\
    \textit{Per-simulation-run setting.}\\
    Configures the fingerprint calculator to consider only certain modules. The
    value is a pattern that will be matched against the module full path by
    default. It may also be an expression containing pattern matching
    characters, field access, and logical operators. The default setting is '*'
    which includes all events in all modules in the calculated fingerprint. If
    you configured multiple fingerprints, separate filters with commas.
\item[fingerprint-results] = \textit{<string>}, default: \ttt{*}\\
    \textit{Per-simulation-run setting.}\\
    Configures the fingerprint calculator to consider only certain results. The
    value is a pattern that will be matched against the result full path by
    default. It may also be an expression containing pattern matching
    characters, field access, and logical operators. The default setting is '*'
    which includes all results in all modules in the calculated fingerprint. If
    you configured multiple fingerprints, separate filters with commas.
\item[fingerprintcalculator-class] = \textit{<string>}, default: \ttt{omnetpp::{\allowbreak}cSingle\-Fingerprint\-Calculator}\\
    \textit{Global setting (applies to all simulation runs).}\\
    Part of the Envir plugin mechanism: selects the fingerprint calculator
    class to be used to calculate the simulation fingerprint. The class has to
    implement the \ttt{cFingerprint\-Calculator} interface.
\item[fname-append-host] = \textit{<bool>}\\
    \textit{Global setting (applies to all simulation runs).}\\
    Turning it on will cause the host name and process Id to be appended to the
    names of output files (e.g. omnetpp.vec, omnetpp.sca). This is especially
    useful with distributed simulation. The default value is true if parallel
    simulation is enabled, false otherwise.
\item[futureeventset-class] = \textit{<string>}, default: \ttt{omnetpp::{\allowbreak}cEvent\-Heap}\\
    \textit{Global setting (applies to all simulation runs).}\\
    Part of the Envir plugin mechanism: selects the class for storing the
    future events in the simulation. The class has to implement the
    \ttt{cFuture\-Event\-Set} interface.
\item[image-path] = \textit{<path>}\\
    \textit{Global setting (applies to all simulation runs).}\\
    A semicolon-separated list of directories that contain module icons and
    other resources. This list with be concatenated with
    \ttt{OMNETPP\_IMAGE\_PATH}.
\item[iteration-nesting-order] = \textit{<string>}\\
    \textit{Per-simulation-run setting.}\\
    Specifies the loop nesting order for iteration variables
    (\ttt{\$\{{\allowbreak}\}{\allowbreak}} syntax). The value is a
    comma-separated list of iteration variables; the list may also contain at
    most one asterisk. Variables that are not explicitly listed will be
    inserted at the position of the asterisk, or appended to the list if there
    is no asterisk. The first variable will become the outermost loop, and the
    last one the innermost loop. Example:
    \ttt{repetition,{\allowbreak}num\-Hosts,{\allowbreak}*,{\allowbreak}ia\-Time}.
\item[load-libs] = \textit{<filenames>}\\
    \textit{Global setting (applies to all simulation runs).}\\
    A space-separated list of dynamic libraries to be loaded on startup. The
    libraries should be given without the \ttt{.{\allowbreak}dll} or
    \ttt{.{\allowbreak}so} suffix -- that will be automatically appended.
\item[max-module-nesting] = \textit{<int>}, default: \ttt{50}\\
    \textit{Per-simulation-run setting.}\\
    The maximum allowed depth of submodule nesting. This is used to catch
    accidental infinite recursions in NED.
\item[measurement-label] = \textit{<string>}, default: \ttt{\$\{{\allowbreak}iterationvars\}{\allowbreak}}\\
    \textit{Per-simulation-run setting.}\\
    Identifies the measurement within the experiment. This string gets recorded
    into result files, and may be referred to during result analysis.
\item[**.module-eventlog-recording] = \textit{<bool>}, default: \ttt{true}\\
    \textit{Per-object setting for simple modules.}\\
    Enables recording events on a per module basis. This is meaningful for
    simple modules only. Usage:
    \ttt{<module-{\allowbreak}full-{\allowbreak}path>.{\allowbreak}module-{\allowbreak}eventlog-{\allowbreak}recording={\allowbreak}true/{\allowbreak}false}.
    Examples:
    \ttt{**.{\allowbreak}router[10..{\allowbreak}20].{\allowbreak}**.{\allowbreak}module-{\allowbreak}eventlog-{\allowbreak}recording
    {\allowbreak}={\allowbreak} {\allowbreak}true};
    \ttt{**.{\allowbreak}module-{\allowbreak}eventlog-{\allowbreak}recording
    {\allowbreak}={\allowbreak} {\allowbreak}false}
\item[ned-path] = \textit{<path>}\\
    \textit{Global setting (applies to all simulation runs).}\\
    A semicolon-separated list of directories. The directories will be regarded
    as roots of the NED package hierarchy, and all NED files will be loaded
    from their subdirectory trees. This option is normally left empty, as the
    OMNeT++ IDE sets the NED path automatically, and for simulations started
    outside the IDE it is more convenient to specify it via a command-line
    option or the NEDPATH environment variable.
\item[network] = \textit{<string>}\\
    \textit{Per-simulation-run setting.}\\
    The name of the network to be simulated.  The package name can be omitted
    if the ini file is in the same directory as the NED file that contains the
    network.
\item[num-rngs] = \textit{<int>}, default: \ttt{1}\\
    \textit{Per-simulation-run setting.}\\
    The number of random number generators.
\item[output-scalar-db-commit-freq] = \textit{<int>}, default: \ttt{100000}\\
    \textit{Global setting (applies to all simulation runs).}\\
    Used with SqliteOutputScalarManager: COMMIT every n INSERTs.
\item[output-scalar-file] = \textit{<filename>}, default: \ttt{\$\{{\allowbreak}resultdir\}{\allowbreak}/{\allowbreak}\$\{{\allowbreak}configname\}{\allowbreak}-{\allowbreak}\$\{{\allowbreak}iterationvarsf\}{\allowbreak}\#\$\{{\allowbreak}repetition\}{\allowbreak}.{\allowbreak}sca}\\
    \textit{Per-simulation-run setting.}\\
    Name for the output scalar file.
\item[output-scalar-file-append] = \textit{<bool>}, default: \ttt{false}\\
    \textit{Per-simulation-run setting.}\\
    What to do when the output scalar file already exists: append to it
    (OMNeT++ 3.x behavior), or delete it and begin a new file (default).
\item[output-scalar-precision] = \textit{<int>}, default: \ttt{14}\\
    \textit{Per-simulation-run setting.}\\
    The number of significant digits for recording data into the output scalar
    file. The maximum value is {\textasciitilde}15 (IEEE double precision).
    This has no effect on SQLite recording, as it stores values as 8-byte IEEE
    floating point numbers.
\item[output-vector-db-indexing] = \textit{<custom>}, default: \ttt{skip}\\
    \textit{Global setting (applies to all simulation runs).}\\
    Whether and when to add an index to the 'vectordata' table in SQLite output
    vector files. Possible values: skip, ahead, after
\item[output-vector-file] = \textit{<filename>}, default: \ttt{\$\{{\allowbreak}resultdir\}{\allowbreak}/{\allowbreak}\$\{{\allowbreak}configname\}{\allowbreak}-{\allowbreak}\$\{{\allowbreak}iterationvarsf\}{\allowbreak}\#\$\{{\allowbreak}repetition\}{\allowbreak}.{\allowbreak}vec}\\
    \textit{Per-simulation-run setting.}\\
    Name for the output vector file.
\item[output-vector-file-append] = \textit{<bool>}, default: \ttt{false}\\
    \textit{Per-simulation-run setting.}\\
    What to do when the output vector file already exists: append to it, or
    delete it and begin a new file (default). Note:
    \ttt{cIndexed\-File\-Output\-Vector\-Manager} currently does not support
    appending.
\item[output-vector-precision] = \textit{<int>}, default: \ttt{14}\\
    \textit{Per-simulation-run setting.}\\
    The number of significant digits for recording data into the output vector
    file. The maximum value is {\textasciitilde}15 (IEEE double precision).
    This setting has no effect on SQLite recording (it stores values as 8-byte
    IEEE floating point numbers), and for the "time" column which is
    represented as fixed-point numbers and always get recorded precisely.

    \textit{Global setting (applies to all simulation runs).}\\
    When cRealTimeScheduler is selected as scheduler class: ratio of simulation

    simulation time to progress twice as fast as runtime.
\item[record-eventlog] = \textit{<bool>}, default: \ttt{false}\\
    \textit{Per-simulation-run setting.}\\

    To control vector recording from a \ttt{@{\allowbreak}statistic}, use
    \ttt{<statistic-{\allowbreak}name>:{\allowbreak}vector {\allowbreak}for
    {\allowbreak}<vector-{\allowbreak}name>}. Example:

    both start and end of an interval are optional, and intervals are separated
    by comma.\\Example:
    \ttt{**.{\allowbreak}round\-Trip\-Time:{\allowbreak}vector.{\allowbreak}vector-{\allowbreak}recording-{\allowbreak}intervals={\allowbreak}..{\allowbreak}100,{\allowbreak}

    first x seconds of the simulation will not be recorded into output vectors,
    and will not be counted into output scalars (see option
    \ttt{**.{\allowbreak}result-{\allowbreak}recording-{\allowbreak}modes}).
    This option is useful for steady-state simulations. The default is 0s (no
    warmup period). Note that models that compute and record scalar results
    manually (via \ttt{record\-Scalar()}) will not automatically obey this
    setting.
\item[warnings] = \textit{<bool>}, default: \ttt{true}\\
    \textit{Per-simulation-run setting.}\\
    Enables warnings.
\item[**.with-akaroa] = \textit{<bool>}, default: \ttt{false}\\
