=== Supported Linux Distributions

This chapter provides instructions for installing @OMNETPP@ on selected Linux
distributions:

* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, 15.10
* Fedora Core 23
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux Desktop Workstation 7.x
* OpenSUSE 42

This chapter describes the overall process.
Distro-specific information, such as how to install the prerequisite
packages, are covered by distro-specific chapters.

[NOTE]
===============================================================================
If your Linux distribution is not listed above, you still may be able to use some
distro-specific instructions in this Guide.

Ubuntu derivatives (Ubuntu instructions may apply):

* Kubuntu, Xubuntu, Edubuntu, ...
* Linux Mint

Some Debian-based distros (Ubuntu instructions may apply, as Ubuntu itself 
is based on Debian):

* Knoppix and derivatives
* Mepis

Some Fedora-based distros (Fedora instructions may apply):

* Simplis
* Eeedora
===============================================================================

=== Installing the Prerequisite Packages

@OMNETPP@ requires several packages to be installed on the computer. These packages
include the C++ compiler (gcc or clang), the Java runtime, and several other libraries and
programs. These packages can be installed from the software repositories of your
Linux distribution.

*See the chapter specific to your Linux distribution for
instructions on installing the packages needed by @OMNETPP@.*

Generally, you will need superuser permissions to install packages.

Not all packages are available from software repositories; some (optional)
ones need to be downloaded separately from their web sites, and
installed manually. See the section 'Additional Packages' later in this
chapter.


=== Downloading and Unpacking

Download @OMNETPP@ from {DOWNLOADSITE}. Make sure you select to download
the generic archive, `@omnetpp@-@version@-src.tgz`.

Copy the archive to the directory where you want to install it. This is usually
your home directory, `/home/<you>`. Open a terminal, and extract the archive
using the following command:

  $ tar xvfz @omnetpp@-@version@-src.tgz

This will create an `@omnetpp@-@version@` subdirectory with the @OMNETPP@ files in it.

[NOTE]
===============================================================
On how to open a terminal on your Linux installation, see the chapter
specific to your Linux distribution.
===============================================================


=== Environment Variables

@OMNETPP@ needs its `bin/` directory to be in the path. To add `bin/` to
`PATH` temporarily (in the current shell only), change into the @OMNETPP@
directory and source the `setenv` script:

  $ cd @omnetpp@-@version@
  $ . setenv

The script also adds the `lib/` subdirectory to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, which may be
necessary on systems that don't support the rpath mechanism.

To set the environment variables permanently, edit `.bashrc` in your home
directory. Use your favourite text editor to edit `.bashrc`, for example gedit:

  $ gedit ~/.bashrc

Add the following line at the end of the file, then save it:

  export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/@omnetpp@-@version@/bin

You need to close and re-open the terminal for the changes to take effect.

Alternatively, you can put the above line into `~/.bash_profile`, but then
you need to log out and log in again for the changes to take effect.

[NOTE]
===============================================================
If you use a shell other than 'bash', consult the man page of that shell
to find out which startup file to edit, and how to set and export variables.

Note that all Linux distributions covered in this Installation Guide
use 'bash' unless the user has explicitly selected another shell.
===============================================================


=== Configuring and Building @OMNETPP@

In the top-level @OMNETPP@ directory, type:

  $ ./configure

The `configure` script detects installed software and configuration of your
system. It writes the results into the `Makefile.inc` file, which will be
read by the makefiles during the build process.

image::pictures/terminal-configuration.png[title="Configuring @OMNETPP@",align="center",scaledwidth="75%"]

Normally, the `configure` script needs to be running under the graphical
environment (X11) in order to test for `wish`, the Tcl/Tk shell. If you are logged in
via an 'ssh' session, or there is some other reason why X is not running,
the easiest way to work around the problem is to tell @OMNETPP@ to build
without Tcl/Tk. To do that, use the command

  $ NO_TCL=1 ./configure

instead of plain `./configure`.

[NOTE]
===============================================================
If there is an error during `configure`, the output may give hints about what
went wrong. Scroll up to see the messages. (Use Shift+PgUp; you may need to increase
the scrollback buffer size of the terminal and re-run `./configure`.) The script
also writes a very detailed log of its operation into `config.log` to help track
down errors. Since `config.log` is very long, it is recommended that you open
it in an editor and search for phrases like 'error' or the name of the package
associated with the problem.
===============================================================

When `./configure` has finished, you can compile @OMNETPP@.
Type in the terminal:

  $ make

image::pictures/terminal-make.png[title="Building @OMNETPP@",align="center",scaledwidth="75%"]

[TIP]
===============================================================
To take advantage of multiple processor cores, add the `-j4` option to the
`make` command line.
===============================================================

[NOTE]
===============================================================
The build process will not write anything outside its directory,
so no special privileges are needed.
===============================================================

[TIP]
===============================================================
The make command will seemingly compile everything twice. This is because
both debug and optimized versions of the libraries are built.
If you only want to build one set of the libraries, specify
`MODE=debug` or `MODE=release`:

  $ make MODE=release
===============================================================


=== Verifying the Installation

You can now verify that the sample simulations run correctly. For example,
the dyna simulation is started by entering the following commands:

    $ cd samples/dyna
    $ ./dyna

By default, the samples will run using the Tcl/Tk environment. You should see
nice gui windows and dialogs.


=== Starting the IDE

You can launch the @OMNETPP@ Simulation IDE by typing the following command
in the terminal:

  $ @omnetpp@

image::pictures/ide-initial.png[title="The Simulation IDE",align="center",scaledwidth="75%"]

If you would like to be able to access the IDE from the application launcher
or via a desktop shortcut, run one or both of the commands below:

  $ make install-menu-item
  $ make install-desktop-icon

Or add a shortcut that points to the `@omnetpp@` program in the `ide` subdirectory
by other means, for example using the Linux desktop's context menu.

=== Using the IDE

When you try to build a project in the IDE, you may get the following warning message:

[quote]
_____________________________________________________________________
Toolchain "..." is not supported on this platform or installation. Please go to the
Project menu, and activate a different build configuration. (You may need to switch
to the C/C++ perspective first, so that the required menu items appear in the Project menu.)
_____________________________________________________________________

If you encounter this message, choose 'Project > Properties > C/C++ Build >
Tool Chain Editor > Current toolchain > GCC for @OMNETPP@'.

The IDE is documented in detail in the 'User Guide'.

=== Reconfiguring the Libraries

If you need to recompile the @OMNETPP@ components with different flags (e.g.
different optimization), then change the top-level @OMNETPP@ directory, edit
`configure.user` accordingly, then type:

    $ ./configure
    $ make cleanall
    $ make

If you want to recompile just a single library, then change to the directory
of the library (e.g. `cd src/sim`) and type:

    $ make clean
    $ make

By default, libraries are compiled in both debug and release mode. If you want
to make release or debug builds only, use:

    $ make MODE=release

or

    $ make MODE=debug

By default, shared libraries will be created. If you want to build static
libraries, set `SHARED_LIBS=no` in `configure.user` and re-configure your 
project.

NOTE: For detailed description of all options please read the 'Build Options' chapter.

=== Additional Packages

Note that at this point, MPI, Doxygen and GraphViz have been installed as part of the prerequisites.

==== Qtenv

@OMNETPP@ 5 comes with a new Qt based runtime environment that supports also 3D visualization.
The new environment can be disabled by commenting out the QT_VERSION variable in the configure.user
file and then running `./configure`.

==== Akaroa

Linux distributions do not contain the Akaroa package. It must be downloaded,
compiled and installed manually before installing @OMNETPP@.

NOTE: As of version 2.7.9, Akaroa only supports Linux and Solaris.

Download Akaroa 2.7.9 from:
  http://www.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/research/RG/net_sim/simulation_group/akaroa/download.chtml

Extract it into a temporary directory:

  $ tar xfz akaroa-2.7.9.tar.gz

////
// Unfortunately, this version does not compile properly with gcc-4.4. A patch is available
// in the `<omnetpproot>/contrib/akaroa` directory to fix the compilation problems. Change
// to the Akaroa root directory and apply the patch to the sources.
//
//  $ cd akaroa-2.7.6
//  $ patch -p1 -i <omnetpproot>/contrib/akaroa/akaroa-2.7.6-gcc-4.4.patch
////

Configure, build and install the Akaroa library. By default, it will be installed into the
`/usr/local/akaroa` directory.

  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ sudo make install

Go to the @OMNETPP@ directory, and (re-)run the `configure` script. Akaroa will be
automatically detected if you installed it to the default location.

==== PCAP

The optional Pcap library allows simulation models to capture and 
transmit network packets bypassing the operating system's protocol stack. 
It is not used directly by @OMNETPP@, but @OMNETPP@ detects the necessary 
compiler and linker options for models in case they need it.

ifdef::OMNEST[]

==== SystemC

To enable SystemC integration, add SYSTEMC=yes to the configure.user
file, run 'configure' and then rebuild your project. You can check the
systemc examples in the samples/systemc-embedding directory.

endif::OMNEST[]

==== Nemiver

Nemiver is the default debugger for the @OMNETPP@ just-in-time debugging facility (see the
`debugger-attach-on-startup` and `debugger-attach-on-error` configuration options).
Nemiver can be installed via the package manager in most Linux distros.
For example, on Ubuntu and other Debian-based distros you can install it by the
following command:

  $ sudo apt-get install nemiver
