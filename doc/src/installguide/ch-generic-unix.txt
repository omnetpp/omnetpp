== Generic Unix

=== Introduction

This chapter provides additional information for installing @OMNETPP@
on Unix-like operating systems not specifically covered by this
Installation Guide. The list includes FreeBSD, Solaris, and Linux
distributions not covered in other chapters.

[NOTE]
===============================================================
In addition to Windows and macOS, the Simulation IDE will only work
on Linux x86 64-bit platforms. Other operating systems (FreeBSD,
Solaris, etc.) and architectures may still be used as simulation
platforms, without the IDE.
===============================================================

=== Dependencies

The following packages are required for @OMNETPP@ to work:

build-essential, GNU make, gcc, g\++, bison (2.4+), flex, perl::
  These packages are needed for compiling @OMNETPP@ and simulation models,
  and also for certain @OMNETPP@ tools to work. Some C++ compilers
  other than g++, for example the Intel compiler, will also be accepted.

The following packages are strongly recommended, because their absence
results in severe feature loss:

Tcl/Tk 8.5 or later::
  Required by the Tkenv simulation runtime environment.
  You need the 'devel' packages that include the C header files as well.
  It is also possible to compile @OMNETPP@ without Tcl/Tk (and Tkenv),
  by setting then `WITH_TKENV=no` variable in configure.user.
LibXML2 or Expat::
  Either one of these XML parsers are needed for @OMNETPP@ to be able
  to read XML files. The 'devel' packages (that include the header files)
  are needed. LibXML2 is the preferred one.
OpenJDK, version 8.0 or later::
  The Java runtime is required to run the Eclipse-based Simulation IDE.
  Other implementations, for example Kaffe, have been found to have problems
  running the IDE. You do not need this package if you do not plan
  to use the Simulation IDE.
Qt 5.4 or later::
  Required by the Qtenv simulation runtime environment.
  You need the 'devel' packages that include header files as well.
OpenSceneGraph (3.2+) and osgEarth (2.5+)::
  These packages will enable 3D visualization in Qtenv.
  You need the 'devel' packages that include header files as well.

The following packages are required if you want to take advantage of some advanced
@OMNETPP@ features:

GraphViz, Doxygen::
  These packages are used by the NED documentation generation feature
  of the IDE. When they are missing, documentation will have less content.

MPI::
  openmpi or some other MPI implementation is required to support
      parallel simulation execution.

Akaroa::
  Implements Multiple Replications In Parallel (MRIP). Akaroa can be downloaded
  from the project's website.

Pcap::
   Allows simulation models to capture and transmit network packets bypassing
   the operating system's protocol stack. It is not used directly by @OMNETPP@,
   but @OMNETPP@ detects the necessary compiler and linker options for models
   in case they need it.

The exact names of these packages may differ across distributions.

=== Determining Package Names

If you have a distro unrelated to the ones covered in this Installation Guide,
you need to figure out what is the established way of installing packages
on your system, and what are the names of the packages you need.

==== Tcl/Tk

Tcl/Tk may be present as separate packages (`tcl` and `tk`), or in one
package (`tcltk`). The version number (e.g. 8.5) is usually part of the name
in some form (`85`, `8.5`, etc). You will need the development packages, which
are usually denoted with the `-dev` or `-devel` name suffix.

Troubleshooting:

If your platform does not have suitable Tcl/Tk and/or QT packages, you may still use @OMNETPP@
to run simulations from the command line. To disable the graphical runtime environment
use:

  $ ./configure WITH_TKENV=no WITH_QTENV=no

This will prevent the build system to link with Tcl/Tk or QT libraries. This is required also
if you are installing @OMNETPP@ from a remote terminal session.

By default, the `configure` script expects to find the Tcl/Tk libraries
in the standard linker path (without any `-Ldirectory` linker option)
and under the standard names (i.e. with the `-ltcl8.5` or `-ltcl85`
linker option). If you have them in different places or under different
names, you have to edit `configure.user` and explicitly set `TK_LIBS` there (see
the Build Options chapter for further details).

If you get the error 'no display and DISPLAY environment variable not set',
then you're either not running X (the `wish` command, and thus `./configure` won't
work just in the console) or you really need to set the `DISPLAY` variable
(`export DISPLAY=:0.0` usually does it).

If you get the error: 'Tcl_Init failed: Can't find a usable init.tcl...'

The `TCL_LIBRARY` environment variable should point to the directory which
contains `init.tcl`. That is, you probably want to put a line like

  export TCL_LIBRARY=/usr/lib/tcl8.5

into your `~/.bashrc`.


==== The Java Runtime

You need to install the Oracle JRE or OpenJDK.
The IDE is not supported on Unix platforms other than Linux, so JRE is not required
either. We have tested various other Java runtimes ('gcj', 'kaffe', etc.), and
the IDE does not work well with them.

Java version 1.8 (i.e. JRE 1.8) or later is required.

==== MPI

@OMNETPP@ is not sensitive to the particular MPI implementation. You may use
OpenMPI, or any other standards-compliant MPI package.

=== Downloading and Unpacking

Download @OMNETPP@ from {DOWNLOADSITE}. Make sure you select to download
the generic archive, `@omnetpp@-@version@-src.tgz`.

Copy the archive to the directory where you want to install it. This is usually
your home directory, `/home/<you>`. Open a terminal, and extract the archive
using the following command:

  $ tar xvfz @omnetpp@-@version@-src.tgz

This will create an `@omnetpp@-@version@` subdirectory with the @OMNETPP@ files in it.

=== Environment Variables

In general @OMNETPP@ requires that its bin directory should be in the PATH. You should
add a line something like this to your `.bashrc`:

  $ export PATH=$HOME/@omnetpp@-@version@/bin:$PATH

You may also have to specify the path where shared libraries are loaded from. Use:

  $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$HOME/@omnetpp@-@version@/lib

If `configure` complains about not finding the Tcl library directory, you may specify it
by setting the `TCL_LIBRARY` environment variable.

[NOTE]
===============================================================
If you use a shell other than bash, consult the man page of that shell
to find out which startup file to edit, and how to set and export variables.
===============================================================

=== Configuring and Building @OMNETPP@

In the top-level @OMNETPP@ directory, type:

  $ ./configure

The `configure` script detects installed software and configuration of your
system. It writes the results into the `Makefile.inc` file, which will be
read by the makefiles during the build process.

image::pictures/terminal-configuration.png[title="Configuring @OMNETPP@",align="center",scaledwidth="75%"]


Normally, the `configure` script needs to be running under the graphical
environment (X11) in order to test for `wish`, the Tcl/Tk shell. If you are logged in
via an ssh session, or there is some other reason why X is not running,
the easiest way to work around the problem is to tell @OMNETPP@ to build
without Tcl/Tk. To do that, use the command

  $ ./configure WITH_TKENV=no WITH_QTENV=no

instead of plain `./configure`.

[NOTE]
===============================================================
If there is an error during `configure`, the output may give hints about what
went wrong. Scroll up to see the messages. (Use Shift+PgUp; you may need to increase
the scrollback buffer size of the terminal and re-run `./configure`.) The script
also writes a very detailed log of its operation into `config.log` to help track
down errors. Since `config.log` is very long, it is recommended that you open
it in an editor and search for phrases like 'error' or the name of the package
associated with the problem.

The `configure` script tries to build and run small test programs that are using
specific libraries or features of the system. You can check the `config.log` file
to see which test program has failed and why. In most cases the problem is that the
script cannot figure out the location of a specific library. Specifying the include file
or library location in the `configure.user` file and then re-running the `configure` script
usually solves the problem.
===============================================================

When `./configure` has finished, you can compile @OMNETPP@.
Type in the terminal:

  $ make

image::pictures/terminal-make.png[title="Building @OMNETPP@",align="center",scaledwidth="75%"]

[TIP]
===============================================================
To take advantage of multiple processor cores, add the `-j8` option
(for 8 cores) to the `make` command line.
===============================================================

[NOTE]
===============================================================
The build process will not write anything outside its directory,
so no special privileges are needed.
===============================================================

[TIP]
===============================================================
The make command will seemingly compile everything twice. This is because
both debug and optimized versions of the libraries are built.
If you only want to build one set of the libraries, specify
`MODE=debug` or `MODE=release`:

  $ make MODE=release
===============================================================


=== Verifying the Installation

You can now verify that the sample simulations run correctly. For example,
the dyna simulation is started by entering the following commands:

    $ cd samples/aloha
    $ ./aloha

By default, the samples will run using the Qtenv environment. You should see
nice gui windows and dialogs.


=== Starting the IDE

[NOTE]
===============================================================
The IDE is supported only on 64-bit versions of Windows, macOS X and Linux.
===============================================================

You can run the IDE by typing the following command in the terminal:

  $ @omnetpp@

image::pictures/ide-initial.png[title="The Simulation IDE",align="center",scaledwidth="75%"]

If you would like to be able to access the IDE from the application launcher or via
a desktop shortcut, run one or both of the commands below:

  $ make install-menu-item
  $ make install-desktop-icon

[NOTE]
===============================================================
The above commands assume that your system has the `xdg` commands,
which most modern distributions do.
===============================================================

=== Optional Packages

==== Akaroa

If you wish to use Akaroa, it must be downloaded, compiled, and installed
manually before installing @OMNETPP@.

NOTE: As of version 2.7.9, Akaroa only supports Linux and Solaris.

Download Akaroa 2.7.9 from:
  http://www.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/research/RG/net_sim/simulation_group/akaroa/download.chtml

Extract it into a temporary directory:

  $ tar xfz akaroa-2.7.9.tar.gz

////
// Unfortunately, this version does not compile properly with gcc-4.4. A patch is available
// in the `<omnetpproot>/contrib/akaroa` directory to fix the compilation problems. Change
// to the Akaroa root directory and apply the patch to the sources.
//
//  $ cd akaroa-2.7.6
//  $ patch -p1 -i <omnetpproot>/contrib/akaroa/akaroa-2.7.6-gcc-4.4.patch
////

Configure, build and install the Akaroa library. By default, it will be installed into the
`/usr/local/akaroa` directory.

  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ sudo make install

Go to the @OMNETPP@ directory, and (re-)run the `configure` script. Akaroa will be
automatically detected if you installed it to the default location.

==== PCAP

The optional Pcap library allows simulation models to capture and
transmit network packets bypassing the operating system's protocol stack.
It is not used directly by @OMNETPP@, but @OMNETPP@ detects the necessary
compiler and linker options for models in case they need it.

ifdef::OMNEST[]

==== SystemC

To enable SystemC integration, add SYSTEMC=yes to the configure.user
file, run 'configure' and then rebuild your project. You can check the
systemc examples in the samples/systemc-embedding directory.
