== Build Options

=== Configure.user Options

The `configure.user` file contains several options that can be used to fine-tune
the simulation libraries.

You always need to re-run the `configure` script in the installation
root after changing the `configure.user` file.

  $ ./configure

After this step, you have to remove all previous libraries and recompile @OMNETPP@:

  $ make cleanall
  $ make

Options:

`PREFER_CLANG=no`::
  If both `gcc` and `clang` are installed on your system, setting this variable to `yes`
  will force the configure script to use `clang` as C++ compiler.

`USE_CXX11=yes`::
  By default @OMNETPP@ is configured to use C++11 language features. This can be disabled if
  your model is not yet compatible with C++11. Future @OMNETPP@ versions may require C++11, so
  it is strongly recommended to update your models as soon as possible.

ifdef::OMNEST[]
`SYSTEMC=no`::
  Use this variable to enable integration whith the bundled SystemC reference implementation.
endif::OMNEST[]

`<COMPONENTNAME>_CFLAGS`, `<COMPONENTNAME>_LIBS`::
  The `configure.user` file contains variables for defining the compile and link options
  needed by various external libraries. By default, the `configure` command detects these
  automatically, but you may override the auto detection by specifying the values by hand.
  (e.g. `<COMP>_CFLAGS=-I/path/to/comp/includedir` and `<COMP>_LIBS=-L/path/to/comp/libdir -lnameoflib`.)

`WITH_PARSIM=no`::
  Use this variable to explicitly disable parallel simulation support in @OMNETPP@.

`WITH_NETBUILDER=no`::
  This option allows you to leave out the NED language parser and
  the network builder. (This is needed only if you are building your network with
  C++ API calls and you do not use the built-in NED language parser at all.)

`NO_TCL=yes`::
  This will prevent the build system to link with Tcl/Tk libraries. Use this option
  if your platform does not have a suitable Tcl/Tk package and you will run the simulation
  only in command line mode. (i.e. You want to run @OMNETPP@ in a remote terminal session.)

`EMBED_TCL_CODE=no`::
  Tcl/Tk is a script language and the source of the graphical
  runtime environment is stored as `.tcl` files in the `src/tkenv` directory.
  By default, these files are not used directly, but are embedded as string literals
  in the executable file. Setting `EMBED_TCL_CODE=yes` allows you to move the
  @OMNETPP@ installation without caring about the location of the `.tcl` files.
  If you want to make changes to the Tcl code, you better switch off the embedding with
  the `EMBED_TCL_CODE=no` option. This way you can make changes to the `.tcl`
  files and see the changes immediately without recompiling the @OMNETPP@ libraries.

`CFLAGS_[RELEASE/DEBUG]`::
  To change the compiler command line options the build process is using, you
  should specify them in the `CFLAGS_RELEASE` and `CFLAGS_DEBUG` variables.
  By default, the flags required for debugging or optimization are detected
  automatically by the `configure` script. If you set them manually, you
  should specify all options you need. It is recommended to check what options are
  detected automatically (check the `Makefile.inc` after running `configure` and
  look for the `CFLAGS_[RELEASE/DEBUG]` variables.) and add/modify
  those options manually in the `configure.user` file.

`LDFLAGS`::
  Linker command line options can be explicitly set using this variable.
  It is recommended to check what options are detected automatically
  (check the `Makefile.inc` after running `configure` and
  look for the `LDFLAGS` variable.) and add/modify those options manually in
  the `configure.user` file.

`SHARED_LIBS`::
  This variable controls whether the @OMNETPP@ build process will create
  static or dynamic libraries. By default, the @OMNETPP@ runtime is built as a set of shared libraries.
  If you want to build a single executable from your simulation, specify `SHARED_LIBS=no`
  in `configure.user` to create static @OMNETPP@ libraries and then reconfigure (`./configure`)
  and recompile @OMNETPP@ (`make cleanall; make`). Once the @OMNETPP@ static libraries are
  correctly built, your own project have to be rebuilt, too. You will get a single, statically
  linked executable, which requires only the NED and INI files to run.

WARNING: It is important to completely delete the @OMNETPP@ libraries (`make cleanall`)
and then rebuild them, otherwise it cannot be guaranteed that the created simulations
are linked against the correct libraries.

NOTE: The `USE_DOUBLE_SIMTIME` and `WITHOUT_CPACKET` options are no longer supported.
They were introduced in @OMNETPP@ 4.0 to help porting model code from @OMNETPP@ 3.x,
and having fulfilled their role, they were removed in @OMNETPP@ 5.0. If you still have
old model code to port, use @OMNETPP@ 4.x.


=== Moving the Installation

When you build @OMNETPP@ on your machine, several directory names are compiled
into the binaries. This makes it easier to set up @OMNETPP@ in the first place,
but if you rename the installation directory or move it to another location in
the file system, the built-in paths become invalid and the correct paths have
to be supplied via environment variables.

The following environment variables are affected (in addition to `PATH`, which
also needs to be adjusted):

`OMNETPP_IMAGE_PATH`::
  This variable contains the list of directories where Tkenv looks for icons.
  Set it to point to the `images/` subdirectory of your @OMNETPP@ installation.

`OMNETPP_TKENV_DIR`::
  This variable points to the directory that contains the Tcl script parts
  of Tkenv, which is by default the `src/tkenv/` subdirectory
  of your @OMNETPP@ installation. Normally you don't need to set this variable,
  because the Tkenv shared library contains all Tcl code compiled in as
  string literals. However, if you compile @OMNETPP@ with the `EMBED_TCL_CODE=no`
  setting and then you move the installation, then you need to set
  `OMNETPP_TKENV_DIR`, otherwise Tkenv won't start.

`LD_LIBRARY_PATH`::
  This variable contains the list of additional directories where shared
  libraries are looked for. Initially, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` is not needed
  because shared libraries are located via the 'rpath' mechanism. When you
  move the installation, you need to add the `lib/` subdirectory
  of your @OMNETPP@ installation to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.

NOTE: On Mac OS X, `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` is used instead of `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.
On Windows, the `PATH` variable must contain the directory where shared
libraries (DLLs) are present.

=== Using Different Compilers

By default, the configure script detects the following compilers automatically in the path:

* Intel compiler (icc, icpc)
* GNU C/C++ (gcc, g++)
* Clang (clang, clang++)
* Sun Studio (cc, cxx)
* IBM compiler (xlc, xlC)

If you want to use compilers other than the above ones, you should
specify the compiler name in the `CC` and `CXX` variables, and re-run the
configuration script.

NOTE: Different compilers may have different command line options. If you use a compiler
  other than the default `gcc`, you may have to revise the `CFLAGS_[RELEASE/DEBUG]` and
  `LDFLAGS` variables.

=== Using Microsoft Visual C++

If you are using the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler on Windows,
the build procedure is slightly different than the one used on Unix platforms.

The major differences are:

 * The file `configuser.vc` must be used to specify your build options instead
   of `configure.user`
 * There is no automatic configuration (`./configure`) for Visual C++ builds. You must
   review and specify each options in `configuser.vc` before compiling @OMNETPP@.
 * The build process is initiated with the command `nmake -f Makefile.vc` instead of `make`.
