	* platdep/timeutil.h (and thus, omnetpp.h) no longer includes
	winsock.h/winsock2.h, because its definitions sometimes conflicted
	with model code. Now the only header that includes winsock.h is
	platdep/sockets.h, but it is NOT under omnetpp.h (code that uses it
	has to include it separately).

	Note that if platdep/sockets.h is used, it MUST precede omnetpp.h
	because of timeval definitions in platdep/timeutil.h

	* created platdep/ subdirectory, and factored out most platform
	dependencies and related utility functions from all parts of
	OMNeT++/OMNEST to header files in here. Notable exceptions are
	coroutines (in src/sim) and named pipes	(in src/sim/parsim), where
	platform differences could not be levelled out by just a few #ifdefs,
	#defines and inline functions.
