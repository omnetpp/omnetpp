 * @brief Queue class for objects derived from cObject.

 * The default behavior of cQueue is a FIFO: you insert elements at the back
 * using insert(), and remove them at the front using pop().
 *
 * cQueue may be set up to act as a priority queue. This requires the user to
 * supply a comparison function.
 *
 * Ownership of cOwnedObjects may be controlled by invoking setTakeOwnership()
 * prior to inserting objects. Objects that cannot track their ownership
 * (cObject but not cOwnedObject) are always treated as owned. Whether an
 * object is owned or not affects the operation of the destructor, clean(),
 * the copy constructor and the dup() method.
