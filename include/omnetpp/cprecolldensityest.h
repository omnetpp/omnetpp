/**
 * @brief Base class for histogram-like density estimation classes.
 *
 * DEPRECATED CLASS, do not use for new classes.
 *
 * For the histogram classes, you need to specify the number of bins
 * and the range. Range can either be set explicitly or you can choose
 * automatic range determination.
 *
 * Automatic range estimation works in the following way:
 *  1. The first *numPrecollect* observations are stored.
 *  2. After having collected a given number of observations, the actual
 *     histogram is set up. The range (min, max) of the  initial values
 *     is expanded rangeExtensionFactoror times, and the result will become
 *     the histogram's range (rangeMin, rangeMax). Based on the range,
 *     the bins are layed out.
 *  3. Then the initial values that have been stored up to this point
 *     will be transferred into the new histogram structure and their
 *     store is deleted -- this is done by the setUpBins() function.
 *
 * You may also explicitly specify the lower or upper limit and have
 * the other end of the range estimated automatically. The setRange...()
 * member functions of cPrecollectionBasedDensityEst deal with setting
 * up the histogram range. It also provides pure virtual functions
 * setUpBins() etc.
 *
 * Subsequent observations are placed in the histogram structure.
 * If an observation falls out of the histogram range, the underflow
 * or overflow counter is incremented.
 *
