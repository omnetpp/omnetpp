/**
 * @brief Represents an event in the discrete event simulator.
 *
 * When events are scheduled, they are inserted into the future events set (FES)
 * where they are (conceptually) stored in timestamp (="arrival time") order.
 * Events are removed from the FES one by one, and processed by invoking their
 * execute() methods. execute() should be overridden in subclasses to carry out
 * the actions associated with the event.
 *
 * If several events have identical timestamp values (arrival times), further fields
 * decide their ordering: first, scheduling priority and then, insertion order.
 *
 * Pure event objects (cEvent) are normally of little interest to the user. Instead,
 * one should use messages and packets (cMessage, cPacket). They are subclassed from
 * cEvent, and their execute() methods automatically delivers the message/packet
 * to the target module.
