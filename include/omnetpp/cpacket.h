/**
 * @brief A subclass of cMessage to represent packets, frames, datagrams,
 * application messages, and similar data.
 *
 * cPacket adds length (measured in bits or bytes), bit error flag, and
 * encapsulation capability to cMessage. Length and bit error flag are
 * significant when the packet travels through a cDatarateChannel or
 * another channel that supports data rate and/or error modelling.
 *
 * cPacket is rarely used "as is". Typically the user wants to subclass it
 * to create specific packet types for various protocols being modelled.
 * The most convenient way to do that are via message declaration files
 * (.msg), which are translated into C++ classes.
 * An example message declaration:
 *
 * \code
 * packet Datagram
 * {
 *     int destAddr = -1; // destination address
 *     int srcAddr = -1;  // source address
 *     int ttl =  32;     // time to live
 * }
 * \endcode
 *
 * @see cSimpleModule, cDatarateChannel, cPacketQueue
 *
 * @ingroup SimProgr
