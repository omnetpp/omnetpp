/**
 * @brief A callback interface for receiving notifications at various stages
 * simulations, including setting up, running, and tearing down..
 *
 * Listeners can be added to cEnvir with its addLifecycleListener() method,
 * and removed with removeLifecycleListener().
 *
 * Simulation lifecycle listeners are mainly intended for use by plug-in
 * classes that extend the simulator's functionality: schedulers, output
 * vector/scalar managers, parallel simulation algorithms and so on. The
 * lifecycle of a such plug-in class is managed by \opp, so one can use
 * their constructor to add the listener to cEnvir, and the destructor
 * to remove it. (The latter is done automatically.)
 *
 * Notifications always refer to the active simulation (see
 * cSimulation::getActiveSimulation()).
 *
 * For standalone listeners that have no other way to be invoked, one can
 * use the `EXECUTE_ON_STARTUP(code)` macro to automatically add a
 * listener when the program starts:
 *
 * ```
 * EXECUTE_ON_STARTUP(getEnvir()->addLifecycleListener(new MyListener()));
 * ```
 *
 * Note that listeners will not be deleted automatically when the program
 * exits. To delete a listener on shutdown, add `delete this;`
 * into the listenerRemoved() method.
