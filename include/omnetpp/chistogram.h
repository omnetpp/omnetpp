/**
 * @brief Generic histogram class, capable of representing both unweighted and
 * weighted distributions. Histogram data are stored as n+1 bin edges and
 * n bin values, both being double-precision floating point values. Upper and
 * lower outliers (as well as positive and negative infinities) are kept as counts
 * (for unweighted statistics) or as sum of weights (for weighted statistics).
 *
 * cHistogram is able to generate random numbers from the stored distribution,
 * and also supports save/load of the histogram data in a file.
 *
 * Bins can be set up directly using methods such as setBinEdges() or
 * createUniformBins(), but it is often more practical to automate it by letting
 * a <i>histogram strategy</i> do it. Histogram strategies are objects that
 * encapsulate the job of setting up and managing histogram bins. For example,
 * histogram strategies may employ a precollection phase to get an estimate of
 * the distribution for laying out the bins. Strategies are also capable of
 * extending the histogram range later by adding new bins as needed, or merging
 * adjacent bins to reduce their count. Strategies that create non-uniform
 * (e.g. equi-probable) bins are also possible to implement. Histogram
 * strategies subclass from cIHistogramStrategy.
 *
 * The default constructor of cHistogram installs a default histogram strategy
 * which was designed to provide a good quality histogram for arbitrary
 * distributions, without manual configuration. It employs precollection
 * and also auto-extends the histogram at runtime, merging neighbouring groups
 * of bins if there would be too many of them after extension.
 *
 * Custom behavior can be achieved by setting up and installing an appropriate
 * strategy class, such as cFixedRangeHistogramStrategy or cAutoRangeHistogramStrategy.
 * There are also convenience methods such as setRange() and setNumBins()
 * that internally use cAutoRangeHistogramStrategy.
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 * Automatic mode:
 *
 * ```
 * cHistogram histogram("histogram");
 * ```
 *
 * Setting up a 50-bin histogram on the range [0,100):
 *
 * ```
 * cAutoRangeHistogramStrategy *strategy = new cAutoRangeHistogramStrategy();
 * strategy->setRange(0, 100);
 * strategy->setNumBins(50);
 * strategy->setMode(cHistogram::MODE_INTEGERS);
 * cHistogram histogram("histogram", strategy);
 * ```
 *
 * The same effect using convenience methods:
 *
 * ```
 * cHistogram histogram("histogram");
 * histogram.setRange(0, 100);
 * histogram.setNumBins(50);
 * histogram.setMode(cHistogram::MODE_INTEGERS);
 * ```
