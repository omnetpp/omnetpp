/**
 * @brief Glob-style pattern matching class, adopted to special \opp requirements.
 * One instance represents a pattern to match.
 *
 * Pattern syntax:
 *   - ? : matches any character except '.'
 *   - * : matches zero or more characters except '.'
 *   - ** : matches zero or more character (any character)
 *   - {a-z} : matches a character in range a-z
 *   - {^a-z} : matches a character NOT in range a-z
 *   - {32..255} : any number (ie. sequence of digits) in range 32..255  (e.g. "99")
 *   - [32..255] : any number in square brackets in range 32..255 (e.g. "[99]")
 *   - backslash \ : takes away the special meaning of the subsequent character
 *
 * The "except '.'" phrases in the above rules apply only in "dottedpath" mode (see below).
 *
 * There are three option switches (see setPattern() method):
 *   - dottedpath: dottedpath=yes is the mode used in omnetpp.ini for matching
 *     module parameters, like this: "**.mac[*].retries=9". In this mode
 *     mode, '*' cannot "eat" dot, so it can only match one component (module
 *     name) in the path. '**' can be used to match more components.
 *     (This is similar to e.g. Java Ant's usage of the asterisk.)
 *     In dottedpath=false mode, '*' will match anything.
 *   - fullstring: selects between full string and substring match. The pattern
 *     "ate" will match "whatever" in substring mode, but not in full string
 *      mode.
 *   - case sensitive: selects between case sensitive and case insensitive mode.
 *
 * Rule details:
 *   - sets, negated sets: They can contain several character ranges and also
 *     enumeration of characters. For example: "{_a-zA-Z0-9}","{xyzc-f}". To
 *     include '-' in the set, put it at a position where it cannot be
 *     interpreted as character range, for example: "{a-z-}" or "{-a-z}".
 *     If you want to include '}' in the set, it must be the first
 *     character: "{}a-z}", or as a negated set: "{^}a-z}". A backslash
 *     is always taken as literal backslash (and NOT as escape character)
 *     within set definitions.
 *     When doing case-insensitive match, avoid ranges that include both
 *     alpha (a-zA-Z) and non-alpha characters, because they might cause
 *     funny results.
 *   - numeric ranges: only nonnegative integers can be matched.
 *     The start or the end of the range (or both) can be omitted:
 *     "{10..}", "{..99}" or "{..}" are valid numeric ranges (the last one
 *     matches any number). The specification must use exactly two dots.
 *     Caveat: "*{17..19}" will match "a17","117" and "963217" as well.

     * Similar to matches(): it returns non-nullptr iif (1) the pattern ends in
     * a string literal (and not, say, '*' or '**') which contains the line suffix
     * (which begins at suffixoffset characters of line) and (2) pattern matches
     * the whole line, except that (3) in matching the pattern's last string literal,
     * it is also accepted if line is shorter than the pattern. If the above
     * conditions hold, it returns the rest of the pattern. The returned
     * pointer is valid until the next call to this method.
     *
     * This method is used by cIniFile's `getEntriesWithPrefix()`, used
     * e.g. to find RNG mapping entries for a module. For that, we have to find
     * all ini file entries (keys) like `"net.host1.gen.rng-NN"`
     * where NN=0,1,2,... In cIniFile, every entry  is a pattern
     * (`"**.host*.gen.rng-1"`, `"**.*.gen.rng-0"`, etc.).
     * So we'd invoke `patternPrefixMatches("net.host1.gen.rng-", 13)`
     * (i.e. suffix=".rng-") to find those entries (patterns) which can expand to
     * `"net.host1.gen.rng-0"`, `"net.host1.gen.rng-1"`, etc.
