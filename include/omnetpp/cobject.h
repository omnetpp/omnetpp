/**
 * @brief cObject is a lightweight class which serves as the root of the
 * \opp class hierarchy. cObject, via virtual and pure virtual methods,
 * defines several properties and mechanisms that are used throughout
 * the entire simulation library.
 *
 * These mechanisms are the following:
 *
 * - Name string. There are three virtual methods: getName(), getFullName()
 *   and getFullPath(). They are expected to be overridden subclasses as cObject
 *   only contains trivial implementations, e.g. getName() always returns the
 *   empty string. getName() returns a "base name"; getFullName() augments
 *   the base name with auxiliary information such as an index; and getFullPath()
 *   includes the object's location in the object hierarchy. An example: for a
 *   module in a network simulation, getName() may return "eth", getFullName()
 *   may return "eth[2]", and getFullPath() may return "Net.host[4].eth[2]".
 *
 * - Class name. getClassName() returns the fully qualified C++ class name.
 *   Its operation is based on the C++ typeid() operator and the type_info class.
 *
 * - Info string. The str() method can be overridden in subclasses to return a
 *   one-line concise description of the object's contents, e.g. for display
 *   in graphical user interfaces.
 *
 * - Cloning. The dup() method is to be overridden in subclasses to return an
 *   exact copy of this object.
 *
 * - Iteration. The forEachChild() method is to be overridden in subclasses to
 *   iterate over (cObject-derived) objects that it contains or holds.
 *   This method is primarily used by graphical user interfaces to display
 *   an object hierarchy, and for searching.
 *
 * - Ownership mechanism. The ownership mechanism helps define an object
 *   containment hierarchy, and also defines responsibility of deletion.
 *   Several methods belong here, the most visible one being getOwner().
 *   A cObject itself does not keep track of its owner (the method returns
 *   nullptr), an actual owner pointer is added by the subclass cOwnedObject.
 *   cObject also provides the drop(), take() and dropAndDelete() methods
 *   that sublasses may utilize in implementing their ownership management.
 *
 * - Packing/unpacking. The parsimPack() and parsimUnpack() methods can be
 *   overridden to allow instances to be transferred via MPI for parallel
 *   simulation.
 *
 * - Reflection. The getDescriptor() method returns a cClassDescriptor object
 *   that allows for enumerating the object's fields, getting/setting their
 *   values, etc.
 *
 * In model code, it usually makes sense to use cObject as a base class for
 * any class that is expected to be polymorphic. In this case, cObject does
 * not add any runtime overhead (as it contains no data members). The
 * appropriate member functions (dup(), str(), etc.) are expected to be
 * redefined.
