/**
 * @brief Options for the cSimpleModule::send() and cSimpleModule::sendDirect() calls.
 *
 * This class currently allows specifying send delay, propagation delay, duration,
 * and sending a transmission update.
 *
 * A convenient way to produce an appropriately configured instance for a send() call
 * is by creating a default instance, and chaining mutator methods:
 *
 * ```
 * send(msg, SendOptions().updateTx(transmissionId, remainingDuration).duration(duration), "out");
 * ```
 *
 * Transmission updates:
 *
 * A transmission update is needed when the transmission of a packet (sending
 * a cPacket over a connection path that contains a transmission channel,
 * i.e. a channel whose isTransmissionChannel() method returns true) needs
 * to be aborted or preempted, extended, or modified in other unforeseen ways
 * while the transmission is in progress.
 *
 * Transmission updates are normal packets (cPacket) sent with the
 * updateTx() or finishTx() options. These methods expect a transmission ID
 * which should be determined when sending the original packet, and specified
 * using the transmissionId() method. A transmission can be updated several
 * times, using always the same transmissionId.
 *
 * The packet in each transmission update conceptually replaces the
 * packet that the peer is going to receive. Updates may be sent
 * while transmission is still ongoing, and, in certain cases,
 * also at the time the packet transmission ends, but not later.
 *
 * As an example, aborting a transmission is done by sending a
 * packet with a truncated content and a remaining duration of zero.
 *
 * Receivers that receive the packet at the end of the reception (default)
 * will only receive the final update, the original packet and
 * intermediate updates are absorbed by the simulation kernel.
 *
 * Receivers that receive the packet at the start of the reception (see
 * cGate::setDeliverImmediately()) should be prepared to receive the
 * original packet and all its updates, and handle them appropriately
 * (i.e. only keep the packet in last update). Transmission updates
 * can be recognized at the receiver end by the cPacket::isUpdate()
 * method returning true. In order to reduce the chance of unprepared
 * modules receiving transmission updates and interpreting them as
 * independent packets leading to erroneous operation, modules will
 * only receive transmission updates if they explicitly declare that
 * they are prepared to handle them by calling
 * cSimpleModule::setTxUpdateSupport(true) beforehand. (If this flag
 * is not set in a module, sending a transmission update to it will
 * result in a runtime error.
 *

/**
 * @brief Base class for all simple module classes.
 *
 * cSimpleModule, although packed with simulation-related functionality,
 * does not do anything useful by itself: one has to subclass from it
 * and redefine one or more virtual member functions to make it do useful work.
 * These functions are:
 *
 *    - void initialize()
 *    - void handleMessage(cMessage *msg)
 *    - void activity()
 *    - void finish()
 *
 * initialize() is called after \opp created the module. Multi-stage
 * initialization can be achieved by redefining the initialize(int stage)
 * method instead, and also redefining the numInitStages() const method to
 * return the required number of stages.
 *
 * One has to redefine handleMessage() to contain the internal logic of
 * the module. handleMessage() is called by the simulation kernel when the
 * module receives a message. (An alternative to handleMessage() is
 * activity(), but activity() is not recommended for serious model development
 * because of scalability and debugging issues. activity() also tends to lead
 * to messy module implementations.)
 *
 * You can send() messages to other modules, or use scheduleAt()+cancelEvent()
 * to implement delays, timers or timeouts. Messages sent or scheduled (but
 * not cancelled) are delivered to modules via handleMessage(), or, when using
 * activity(), via receive().
 *
 * The finish() functions are called when the simulation terminates
 * successfully. Typical use of finish() is recording statistics collected
 * during simulation.
