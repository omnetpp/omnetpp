 * the scheduler object calls usleep() from takeNextEvent() to synchronize the
 * simulation time to real time, that is, to wait until
 * the current time minus base time becomes equal to the simulation time.
 * Should the simulation lag behind real time, this scheduler will try to catch up
 * by omitting sleep calls altogether.
 *
 * Scaling is supported via the realtimescheduler-scaling omnetpp.ini entry.
 * For example, if it is set to 2.0, the simulation will try to execute twice
 * as fast as real time.
