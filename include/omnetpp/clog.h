/**
 * @brief This is the macro underlying EV_INFO, EV_DETAIL, EV_INFO_C, and
 * similar log macros.
 *
 * This macro should not be used directly, but via the logging macros
 * EV, EV_FATAL, EV_ERROR, EV_WARN, EV_INFO, EV_DETAIL, EV_DEBUG, EV_TRACE,
 * and their "category" versions EV_C, EV_FATAL_C, EV_ERROR_C, EV_WARN_C,
 * EV_INFO_C, EV_DETAIL_C, EV_DEBUG_C, EV_TRACE_C.
 *
 * Those macros act as C++ streams: one can write on them using the
 * left-shift (<<) operator. Their names refer to the log level they
 * represent (see LogLevel). The "category" (_C) versions accept a category
 * string. Each category acts like a separate log channel; for example,
 * one can use the "test" category to log text intended for consumption
 * by an automated test suite.
 *
 * Log statements are wrapped with compile-time and runtime guards at the
 * call site to efficiently prevent unnecessary computation of parameters
 * and log content. Compile-time guards are COMPILETIME_LOGLEVEL and
 * COMPILETIME_LOG_PREDICATE. Runtime guards (runtime log level) can be
 * set up via omnetpp.ini.
 *
 * Under certain circumstances, compiling log statements may result in errors.
 * When that happens, it is possible that the EV_STATICCONTEXT macro needs to
 * be added to the code; please review its documentation for more info.
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 * ```
 * EV << "Connection setup complete" << endl;  // equivalent to EV_INFO << ...
 * EV_DEBUG << "retryCount=" << retryCount << std::endl;
 * EV_WARNING << "Connection timed out\n";
 * EV_INFO_C("testing") << "ESTAB" << endl;
 * ```
