# configure.user
#
# This file contains additional input for 'configure'. It is read (sourced)
# during the configuration process. You are free to edit the settings in here.
#
# The settings in this file are all optional in the sense that they all
# have reasonable default values in the configure script.
#

#
# Edit here if you want to use a different compiler from the one autodetected
# by configure.
#
#CC=gcc
#CXX=g++

#
# Compiler optimization switches. There are two sets of switches,
# and the MODE variable ("debug" or "release") decides which one gets used.
# (Note: For maximum debugging info use switch -ggdb or -gstabs+3 when using gcc and gdb)
# With gcc, do NOT use --omit-frame-pointer (it crashes when coroutines and
# C++ exceptions (throw/catch) are used together)!
#
#CFLAGS_DEBUG='-g -Wall'
#CFLAGS_RELEASE='-O2 -DNDEBUG=1'

#
# It is possible to have the Tcl files embedded into the compiled OMNeT++
# libraries and executables. This can be useful if you want to ship
# self-contained standalone executables which do not rely on external
# Tcl scripts. This option is available for Tkenv.
#
EMBED_TCL_CODE=no

#
# Set to "yes" to enable simulation executables to load NED files dynamically.
#
WITH_NETBUILDER=yes

#
# Set to "yes" to enable the parallel distributed simulation feature.
#
WITH_PARSIM=yes

#
# Compiler and linker options for Tcl/Tk
#
# You can explicitly tell 'configure' which compile switches (TK_CFLAGS)
# and linker switches (TK_LIBS) are needed to build an application with Tcl/Tk.
# Normally these settings are autodetected by 'configure', so you only need to
# edit here if autodetection doesn't work.
#
# With gcc, settings typically look like this:
#
# exaple:TK_CFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include"
# example:TK_LIBS="-L/usr/local/lib -ltk8.4 -ltcl8.4"
#
# /usr/local/include should be replaced with the directory where tcl.h and tk.h
# live. If they are in two different directories, use two -I switches.
#
# /usr/local/lib should be replaced with the directory that contains the Tcl/Tk
# library files (something like libtcl84.so, libtk8.4.a etc; search for libtcl*
# and libtk* to find them.) The -l options contain the library names: the
# library file names, with the leading 'lib' and trailing '.so*' or '.a*' cut
# off. Sometimes you need to explicitly link with the X11 libraries too, in that
# case add -lX11 to TK_LIBS.
#
# With MinGW I use the following:
# Note that we are using the "bin" directory as the LIB dir. 
# i.e. directly linking to the DLLs instead of the importlibs in the "lib" directory.
#
#TK_CFLAGS="-I/c/Tools/Tcl-8.4.11/include"
#TK_LIBS="-L/c/Tools/Tcl-8.4.11/bin -ltk84 -ltcl84"
# or:
#TK_CFLAGS="-I$MSYS/include/tcl8.4"
#TK_LIBS="-L$MSYS/bin -ltk84 -ltcl84"

#
# With Cygwin, you can try:
# examle:TK_CFLAGS=
# examle:TK_LIBS="-ltk84 -ltcl84"
#
# If commented out, the configure script will try to autodetect it
#
# If you don't have Tcl/Tk installed, adding
#  NO_TCL=true
# below lets you build just the non-GUI components.

#
# BLT is a Tcl/Tk extension needed by the Tkenv component of OMNeT++.
# BLT 2.4z is required. BLT_LIBS should contain the -l flag for BLT.
# Default setting is:
#  BLT_LIBS="-lBLT24"
#
# 
#BLT_LIBS=

#
# ZLib is a compression library needed by libxml2 and Tkenv's png support.
#
# On MinGW we use the following (dynamically linking against the DLL)
#
#ZLIB_CFLAGS="-I/c/Tools/zlib-1.2.3/include"
#ZLIB_LIBS="-L/c/Tools/zlib-1.2.3/bin -lzlib1"
# or:
#ZLIB_CFLAGS="-I$MSYS/include"
#ZLIB_LIBS="-L$MSYS/lib -lz"

#
# Compiler flags used to compile JNI code.
# -fno-strict-aliasing is needed for gcc when using -O2 otherwise Java
# native calls don't work
#
#JAVA_CFLAGS=-fno-strict-aliasing

#
# Compiler and linker options for MPI (optional component).
# On LAM/MPI, typing `mpic++ -showme' can give you a hint about MPI_LIBS.
#
# If commented out, the configure script will try to autodetect it
#
#MPI_CFLAGS="-I /usr/include"
#MPI_LIBS="-pthread -llammpio -llammpi++ -llamf77mpi -lmpi -llam -laio -laio -lutil"
#MPI_LIBS="-lmpi++ -lmpi"   #SGI

#
# Compiler and linker options for Expat (optional component)
#
# With MinGW I use the following:
#   EXPAT_CFLAGS="-I/d/home/tools/expat-1.95.2/Source/lib"
#   EXPAT_LIBS="-L/d/home/tools/expat-1.95.2/libs -lexpat"
# If commented out, the configure script will try to autodetect it
#
#EXPAT_CFLAGS=
#EXPAT_LIBS=

#
# Compiler and linker options for LIBXML (optional component)
#
# With MinGW I use the following:
#  LIBXML_CFLAGS="-I/c/Tools/libxml2-2.6.20.win32/include -I/c/Tools/iconv-1.9.1.win32/include"
#  LIBXML_LIBS="-L/c/Tools/libxml2-2.6.20.win32/bin -lxml2 -L/c/Tools/iconv-1.9.1.win32/lib -liconv"
# or:
#  LIBXML_CFLAGS="-I$MSYS/include"
#  LIBXML_LIBS="-L$MSYS/bin -lxml2 -L$MSYS/bin -liconv"
# If commented out, the configure script will try to autodetect it
#

#
# Compiler and linker options for Akaroa (optional component)
#
# With MinGW I use the following:
#  AKAROA_CFLAGS="-I/d/home/tools/akaroa-2.7.2/src/include"
#  AKAROA_LIBS="-L/d/home/tools/akaroa-2.7.2/lib/include -lakaroa"
# If commented out, the configure script will try to autodetect it
#
#AKAROA_CFLAGS=
#AKAROA_LIBS=

#
# The following OMNETPP_* variables don't need to be touched unless

# Some more OMNeT++ variables. They select the programs opp_makemake-generated
# makefiles will use. (They get default values if commented out.)

#
# Override the following setting if you have additional icons somewhere else.

# On MinGW we use the following
