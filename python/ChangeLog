2024-05-23  Andras Varga

	* omnetpp.ned: Initial revision of package that allows for loading and
	browsing NED types from Python.

2024-04-10  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave: Make enum strip edges on "vectors on separate axes" charts
	opt-in, for faster rendering

2024-04-10  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave: Fix FutureWarning in `utils.fill_missing_titles`, trying to
	modify a column in place.

	"FutureWarning: A value is trying to be set on a copy of a DataFrame or
	Series through chained assignment using an inplace method."

2024-04-10  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave: Fix NameError in enum strip legend click handler,
	used in the "Vectors on separate axes" chart template

2024-04-10  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave: nit: Simplify utils._plot_enum.compute_conversion_factor()

2024-04-10  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave: Raise minimum required Matplotlib version to 3.5.3,
	to fix the errors in "Plot vectors on separate axes" charts, with enums
	and edges.

2024-04-22  Andras Varga

	* omnetpp.scave: Hide symbol from legend if there's only one item.

	Motivation: in the "Vectors as separate plots", eacvh vector is plotted
	in its separate strip. Then the legend often covers a significant part of
	the plot, and the marker in the legend could be mistaken for a valid data
	point in the plot.

2024-04-22  Andras Varga

	* omnetpp.scave: Added "Omit empty vectors" to input pages of charts taking
	vectors as input.

2024-04-05  Andras Varga

	* omnetpp.scave: Fix last value not painted when enum vectors are plotted as
	colored strips, in plot_vectors_separate()

2024-04-04  Andras Varga

	* omnetpp.scave: utils.py: Parse enum spec correctly in plot_vectors_separate().
	Enum spec comes from "enum" result attribute of vector result.

	"A, B, C" -> {'A': 0, 'B': 1, 'C': 2}
	"A=1, B, C=5, D" -> {'A': 1, 'B': 2, 'C': 5, 'D': 6}

2024-03-22  Andras Varga

	* omnetpp.scave: Use logging instead of print [revised by Attila]

2023-04-03  Levente Mészáros

	* omnetpp.scave: Added set_verbose_export() in utils.py, for controlling
	whether or not export_image_if_needed()/export_data_if_needed() prints the
	the "exporting..." message. Also, changed "exporting..." to "Exported..."

2024-03-22  Andras Varga

	* omnetpp.scave: Refactor/fix try-except blocks in image/data export

2024-03-22  Andras Varga

	* omnetpp.scave: Fix: Get rid of leading "./" in export file names.

2024-01-18  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave: Fix: Avoid "The truth value of a Series is ambiguous"
	errors in utils._check_same_unit()

2023-10-13  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave: Fix "AttributeError: Can only use .str accessor with string
	values!" errors

	This occurred when get_results was called with an empty DataFrame. Fixed
	by ensuring that DataFrames returned from the results module have the
	right columns with the right dtypes.

	This is a backport of: 52fcaa2213 ("scave/python: Fix the newly added
	results_api test cases", 2023-10-13)

2023-12-13  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave: Consider different kinds of "non-units" as the same in
	chart scripts

2023-12-13  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave: Fix import error reporting in results_nativemodule

2023-10-18  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave: Avoid another FutureWarning in utils.py when calling
	pivot_table

2023-10-18  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave: Make legend ordering work for bar charts as well

2023-10-18  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave: Add a workaround for zero-dimensional NumPy arrays in
	result DFs.

	As described in: https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/53565

2023-10-18  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave: Delete the results_scavetool backend

	It was only a fallback, and it wasn't actively tested or maintained anymore.
	And it wasn't a particularly nice solution in the first place.

2023-10-10  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave: Avoid FutureWarning spam from Pandas 2.1 in
	results_nativemodule, by not concatenating into an empty DataFrame.

2023-10-03  Andras Varga

	* omnetpp.scave: In charts, accept "-->" in legend replacements, too.

	Interpretation of the "legend_replacements" property changed.

2023-10-03  Andras Varga

	* omnetpp.scave: utils.py: added add_legend_labels(), sort_rows_by_legend(),
	ordering.xswt

2023-09-16  Andras Varga

	* omnetpp.scave: added sort=True argument to plotting functions.

	Original plotting functions sorted dataframe items before plotting, which
	made it impossible for the user to sort them differently
	(pre-sorting had no effect). This was BAAAAAAAAD.

	Now, by passing sort=False, user can turn off internal sorting, which
	allows sorting the dataframe rows before plotting.

	The `sort=True` mode is considered obsolete; it is only the default to
	retain backward compatibility

2023-09-27  Levente Mészáros

	* omnetpp.scave: utils.py: Added plot_enum. Fix for plot_vectors_separate().
	Fixed plot_enum guard for nan values.

2023-10-03  Levente Mészáros

	* omnetpp.scave: utils.py: Fixed calling make_legend_label() for both named
	tuples and series.

2023-09-29  Andras Varga

	* omnetpp.scave: results: allow commenting out lines in filter expressions
	with '#'

2023-09-25  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave: Fix loading result files from relative input patterns when
	not invoked from next to the .anf file by changing into the .anf directory
	for loading result files already, in analysis.py.

2023-09-07  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave: fix: Go through the suffix fallbacks when importing
	scave_bindings in utils.py too.

	Just us in results_nativemodule already did. This avoids an ImportError
	in the IDE when only a debug mode runtime is built.

2023-09-07  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave: fix: Make chart scripts work again in the IDE without a
	built runtime, by importing scave_bindings from utils.py lazily, only when
	necessary, for converting units.

2023-09-21  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave: fix: Non-existent files in analysis input patterns are not
	an error.

2023-09-21  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave: Fix result file loading when input pattern is a directory.
	The glob matching was done relative to the directory given as input
	pattern, but it was tried to be loaded relative to PWD.

2023-09-07  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave: Fix: Avoid "DataFrame does not contain a 'unit' column" errors
	when plotting results where none of them has a "unit" attribute.

2023-08-17  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave: Update scave_bindings stub file.

2023-08-17  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave: In result query functions, make it the default to convert
	quantities to the base unit by default (convert_to_base_unit=True).

2023-08-17  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave: Cleanup parameter passing in results.py to impl,
	so it is similar to the get_scalars, get_vectors, etc. case.

2023-08-16  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave: Add convert_to_base_unit parameter to
	results.get_[scalars|vectors|statistics|histograms]()

2023-08-16  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave: Add fallback from results_nativemodule to results_scavetool

2023-08-16  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave: Performance: Use dedication function xyArrayToNumpyArrays()
	for copyingXYArrays into numpy arrays, instead of for-loop.

2023-08-15  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave: Add utils.convert_to_base_unit(df) and
	UnitConversion.convertUnitArray()

2023-04-06  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave: Rename results_standalone impl to results_scavetool

2023-04-06  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave: Port tools from results_standalone to results_nativemodule.

2023-04-06  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave: Added impl/results_nativemodule.py that uses scave_bindings

2023-03-30  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave: Add Python bindings to the scave library using nanobind

2023-03-14  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave: Set default X axis label to "Simulation Time [s]" when
	plotting vectors.

2023-03-13  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave: Always include the "unit" attribute (if present) in the
	returned data frame when querying results, regardless of include_attrs.

2023-03-10  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave: feature: Require results to be in the same unit before
	plotting.

2023-03-17  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave: Make loading results much faster in standalone mode
	by switching to `df.apply(..., raw=True)` instead of `df.transform(...)`,
	thereby avoiding string indexing into each row.

2023-02-08  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave: Detect and warn specifically about legacy (<6.0) anf files
	in Analysis.from_anf_file()

2023-02-10  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave: Add filename as context to any exception in
	Analysis.from_anf_file()

2023-02-06  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave: Feature: Add `suppress_print` option Analysis.run_chart()
	to discard output from chart scripts.

2022-08-26  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave.analysis: feature: Load the newly added Chart.created_with in
	analysis.py

2024-02-01  ------ omnetpp-6.0.3 released ------

2024-01-22  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp/scave: doc: Fix "SyntaxWarning: invalid escape sequence" Python warnings

2024-01-05  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp/scave: Change automatic line chart area computation logic. Add margins
	to avoid data points drawn too long to the border of the plot.

2023-12-13  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp/scave: nit: Fix an "Expression value is unused" lint by removing a stray
	trailing comma.

2023-10-06  ------ omnetpp-6.0.2 released ------

2023-09-28  Andras Varga

	* omnetpp/scave: utils.py: do not display an empty legend

2023-04-27  Levente Meszaros

	* omnetpp/scave:n Fixed division by zero warnings in timeavg. When the divisor is
	zero the result will also be zero.

2023-02-06  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp/scave: Drop the now-removed second argument to random.shuffle.
	This was deprecated in Python 3.9 and removed in Python 3.11.

2023-02-06  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp/scave: Use pandas.concat instead of the deprecated DataFrame.append.
	This fixes a couple of DeprecationWarnings.

	df_c = df_a.append(df_b) -> df_c = pd.concat([df_a, df_b])

2023-02-06  Attila Torok

	* opp_scavetool: fix: Don't turn scalars of value 0 into NaNs (or "" in CSV)

	This fixes the ValueError('x and y must have same first dimension, but
	have shapes (21,) and (20,)') in the "Throughput vs. SNIR in the case of
	2000-byte packet size and 250-byte fragmentation threshold" chart in the
	"inet/showcases/wireless/fragmentation/Fragmentation.anf" file.

2023-03-14  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp/scave: Use line_terminator or lineterminator in Dataframe.to_csv,
	depending on Pandas version. It was renamed in in a backwards-compatible
	way, but with an annoying FutureWarning.

2022-08-25  Andras Varga

	* omnetpp/scave: analysis.py: added missing docstring

2022-08-25  Andras Varga

	* omnetpp/scave: Workspace: fix recently introduced subtle bug.

	One MUST NOT use mutable objects as default values to functions, because
	any change the functions makes to those values inside will affect further
	calls.

	def func(d = []):
	    print("d = ", d)
	    d.append(7)

	func()  --> [] func()  --> [7] func()  --> [7, 7] func()  --> [7, 7, 7]
	etc.

	See https://nikos7am.com/posts/mutable-default-arguments/

2022-08-23  Andras Varga

	* omnetpp/scave: Workspace: rename internal var: project_paths -> project_locations

2022-08-23  Andras Varga

	* omnetpp/scave: Workspace: cosmetics: use f-strings instead of string.format() and
	string concatenation. Also: refine one of the "Cannot determine location..."
	error messages.

2022-08-23  Andras Varga

	* omnetpp/scave: Workspace: fix: look for projects by real name. "Real name" being
	the one in the .project file, not the directory name.

2022-08-23  Andras Varga

	* omnetpp/scave: Workspace: fix: better treatment of workspace_dir, more
	resilient get_project_location()

	- Workspace ctor: accept workspace_dir=None too, for "not known"
	- find_workspace(): return None if .metadata was not found, instead if
	  lying something
	- get_project_location(): if there is no Eclipse workspace, look for
	  project next to existing known project
	- get_project_location(): improved error reporting

2022-08-23  Andras Varga

	* omnetpp/scave: Workspace: Fix error if a renamed project is not directly
	under the Eclipse workspace directory.

	"renamed project" = where name in .project differs from folder name

	find_enclosing_project() changes:
	- remember project location
	- method no longer static (API change)

2022-08-23  Andras Varga

	* omnetpp/scave: Workspace: fix: better error message (more specific info on
	why project was not found)

2022-06-08  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp/scave: Reload mpl and plt before exporting an image to make it
	reproducible. While this is not an ideal solution by far, we found
	no other way.

2022-05-26  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp/scave: Add "python" folder of [referenced] project[s] to python
	path in opp_charttool as well

2022-09-01  ------ omnetpp-6.0.1 released ------

2022-08-23  Andras Varga

	* Workspace class: Revised to have a more correct and well-defined handling
	of Eclipse workspaces and projects of the IDE, now with tests. Changes include:

	  - Improved handling of "renamed" projects, i.e. those where the name in
	    the .project file differs from the folder name.

	  - Improved handling of "moved" projects, i.e. those not under the workspace
	    directory. When the main project references such projects, they are now
	    found more reliably. If there is no Eclipse workspace, referenced
	    projects are looked for next to existing known projects.

	  - Better (more informative) error messages if something goes wrong.

	  - Workspace class constructor now accepts workspace_dir=None, for "not known".

	  - find_workspace() now returns None if a .metadata directory was not found,
	instead of making up something.

	  - find_enclosing_project() is no longer static.

2022-06-08  Attila Torok

	* Reload mpl and plt before exporting an image to make it reproducible

2022-05-26  Attila Torok

	* Add the `python/` folders of [referenced] project[s] to the Python
	path in opp_charttool as well.

2022-04-11  ------ omnetpp-6.0 released ------

2022-03-31  Attila Torok

	* export_image_if_needed(): Use noninteractive MPL backends when exporting
	images, set MPI.

2022-03-29  Attila Torok

	* export_image_if_needed(): Make sure that constant vector data is not
	stuck to the chart edge in case of native chart

2022-03-30  Attila Torok

	* get_scalars(): do not fail when the result would be empty

2022-03-30  Attila Torok

	* Analysis: Store/restore mpl.rcParams before/after running a chart

2022-03-30  Attila Torok

	* Fix check of whether image and data export was unsuccessful

2022-03-26  Andras Varga

	* export_image_if_needed(): save sw version info as metadata

2022-01-26  Attila Torok

	* Add __version__=6.0.0 into all scave submodules.

2022-01-26  Attila Torok

	* Delete the now-defunct pure-Python resultloader module for now.
	It wasn't updated to newer scave file format versions.

2022-01-14  Attila Torok

	* Fix the "All" option (minor lines) for grid in ideplot

2022-01-07  Attila Torok

	* utils.py docstring updates

2021-12-17  Attila Torok

	* Better error reporting from vector operations

2021-12-21  Attila Torok

	* utils.py: export: Also allow "=" in sanitized filenames

2021-12-21  Attila Torok

	* results_standalone.py: Ensure result-type-specific columns
	exist in returned df

2021-12-15  Andras Varga

	* omnetpp.scave: utils.py improvements:

	- New functions (factored out from chart scripts): plot_lines(),
	  plot_boxwhiskers(), pivot_for_barchart(), pivot_for_scatterchart(),
	  get_confidence_level()

	- plot_bars(): Accept meta_df, expect data df in transposed form.

2021-12-17  Andras Varga

	* omnetpp.scave: vectorops: timeavg: More helpful error message when wrong
	interpolation mode is given

2021-12-15  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave: Fix outside legend placement when exporting native charts

2021-12-15  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave: postconfigure fix: use is_native_plot() instead of
	is_native_chart()

2021-12-08  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave: plot_bars() to accept a meta_df, in order to be able to
	generate better legend and axis labels and plot titles.

2021-12-11  Andras Varga

	* omnetpp.scave: ChartTemplate.create_chart(): disallow adding properties
	not defined in the chart template

	Note: this uncovers bugs in the scatter chart and other templates: they
	don't define "include_fields", but the chart needs it -> error.

2021-12-11  Andras Varga

	* omnetpp.scave: analysis.py: fix image export when running from a different
	working dir

2021-12-10  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave: results.py: Fix reading empty vectors, return empty arrays
	instead of None.

2021-12-10  Andras Varga

	* omnetpp.scave: ChartTemplate: rename make_chart() to create_chart()

2021-12-10  Andras Varga

	* omnetpp.scave: fix chart.is_native_chart()

2021-12-10  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave: Fix utils.extract_label_columns for the 1 row case,
	blacklist "repetition" because "replication" is nicer.

2021-12-08  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave: Fix pick_two_columns in utils, broken by recent
	extract_label_columns changes

2021-11-11  Andras Varga

	* omnetpp.scave: added charttemplate.py. Provides functionality
	for loading of chart templates, instantiating charts from chart
	templates, etc.

2021-12-07  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave: Print message of exceptions caught from within
	set_observed_column_names.

2021-12-07  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave: Raise chart.ChartScriptError from
	utils.assert_columns_exist(). This automatically sets the warning text,
	and tests expect this.

2021-12-07  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave: Fix set_observed_column_names() in charttool impl
	of chart module. Parameter names have to match with those in the
	interface modules

2021-12-07  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave: Improvements in utils.extract_label_columns(),
	make_legend_label() and make_chart_title()

2021-12-06  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave: Fix warnings from MPL when computing confidence
	intervals (for bar- and scatterplots)

2021-12-03  Andras Varga

	* omnetpp.scave: Move call of set_observed_column_names() to export_data_if_needed()

2021-12-03  Andras Varga

	* omnetpp.scave: automatic legend: added "prefer module display path to module
	path" option; dialog and code refactoring

2021-12-03  Andras Varga

	* omnetpp.scave: Fix and improve charttemplates tests

2021-11-29  Andras Varga

	* omnetpp.scave: proper error handling for legends

2021-11-30  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave: Introduce ChartScriptError, raise it from chart scripts where
	needed instead of manually setting the plot warning text and calling
	(an alias to) sys.exit(1).

2021-11-30  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave: Add the timedilation vector operation

2021-11-16  Levente Meszaros

	* omnetpp.scave: Change default of width and height in export_image() to
	None, so that they don't override the properties stored in the chart itself
	when no value is given for these parameters. And there are defaults
	anyway on both the higher and lower levels anyway
	(in the XSWT form, and in export_image_if_needed()).

2021-11-28  Andras Varga

	* omnetpp.scave: chart.py: added set_observed_column_names(). This is
	useful for providing content assist for column names in the legend format
	string.

2021-11-29  Andras Varga

	* omnetpp.scave.analysis: utils.py: no longer append the optional 'comment'
	df column to the legend. Reason: that feature is not longer needed, because
	we have legend format strings (user can add "$comment" to it if they want)

2021-11-26  Andras Varga

	* omnetpp.scave.analysis: utils.py: support for legend_format and
	legend_replacements.

2021-11-17  Andras Varga

	* opp_charttool: improved 'info' command; Analysis.info() removed

	- opp_charttool: 'info' command: listing format change
	- opp_charttool: let filtering (-i, -n) apply to the 'info' command too
	- info() moved from Analysis into opp_charttool

2021-11-16  Andras Varga

	* omnetpp.scave.analysis: Added Folder support to Analysis API

2021-11-10  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave.analysis: Minor chart execution fixes.

2021-10-29  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave.utils: Add digit grouping to tick labels in MPL-emulated
	native charts.

2021-10-26  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave.utils: Make MPL-emulated native widgets more similar
	to the IDE (axis limits, number format for ticks, etc.)

2021-10-15  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave.plot: Restore the omnetpp.scave.plot module for
	compatibility. It falls back to the new omnetpp.scave.ideplot package
	after issuing a warning.

2021-10-11  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave.utils: assert_columns_exist() to raise ValueError from
	instead of calling exit() (which a library is not supposed to do).

2021-10-07  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave.utils: plot_bars(), plot_vectors(), plot_histograms(): Sort
	results by legend label (or indices, for bar charts) before plotting.

2021-10-07  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave.utils: Fix: Make legend options work again with non-native charts

2021-10-05  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave: Rename omnetpp.scave.plot module to omnetpp.scave.ideplot,
	because it better describes its functionality (accessing native plots in the
	IDE).

2021-10-04  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave: Refactoring: Rename internal package impl_charttool to
