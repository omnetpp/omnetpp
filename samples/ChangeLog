2024-10-08  ------ omnetpp-6.1.0 released ------

2024-08-27  Attila Torok

	* aloha: fix: Don't leave deleted messages as associated objects on figures.
	This fixes crashes when clicking on the ring/circle figures, especially when
	running in Fast mode.

2024-07-24  Rudolf Hornig

	* osg-indoor: fix: Removed m unit from playground parameters

2024-06-24  Attila Torok

	* resultfiles: Update/reset all charts to current template; add another
	analysis file with aloha charts.

2024-05-30  Andras Varga

	* ChangeLog: Merged per-folder ChangeLog files into a common ChangeLog.
	(Entries below this one were produced by merging the contents of
	individual ChangeLogs.)

2022-05-16  Attila Torok

	* all: Use C++ headers instead of C ones, e.g. <cstdlib> instead of <stdlib.h>

	* neddemo, routing, cqn: omnetpp.ini: Eliminate unused entries.

	* tictoc: tictoc18.ned: Fix range mistake in NED for loop. (The end of the range
	is unconventionally included in NED.)

	Source: https://github.com/omnetpp/docs.omnetpp.org/issues/15

	* queueinglib: Fix missing @enum value in NED file. Now that parameter values are
	checked against @enum, it caused an error in a queuenet simulation.

2024-02-01  ------ omnetpp-6.0.3 released ------

2024-01-05  Rudolf Hornig

2022-09-19  Attila Torok

	* osg-indoor: Fix: Don't fail to build without OSG[EARTH] if they are not even
	installed

2022-08-25  Attila Torok

	* os-intro, osg-indoor, osg-satellites, osg-earth: Fix: Make sure config.h
	is included before checking for WITH_OSG and WITH_OSGEARTH.

	So the code using OSG and osgEarth actually has a chance to be built and
	used. This did not matter back when these macros were defined on the
	compiler command line by the build system, but now it does.

2022-09-19  Attila Torok

	* osg-satellites, osg-earth: Fix: Don't fail to build without OSG[EARTH] if
	they are not even installed.

	unsigned long as long is not 64-bit on Windows.

2021-02-09  Rudolf Hornig

	* all: Follow icon change: block/queue -> block/activeq, block/passiveq -> block/queue

2018-12-03  Andras Varga

	* histograms: Improved to be a better demo: updated omnetpp.ini so that all
	(distribution, histogram) pairs make sense, e.g. not generate
	[0,1) and collect a histogram on [10,20).

	* histograms: Added usage hint to the canvas.

2019-01-24  Andras Varga

	* histograms: histograms.cc: Eliminate AutoRangeStrategyBuilder for code simplicity.

2018-12-03  Attila Torok

	* histograms: Remove a lot of configs and histogram setups. As this sample is
	no longer used for fingerprint testing, there is no need to have
	it so complicated.

2022-03-23  Rudolf Hornig

	* sockets: Fixed missing `parent.` prefix causing an error in sockets example.

2021-12-18  Andras Varga

	several times. Result files were also kept up to date.

2021-06-09  Andras Varga

	* database: cMySQLConfigReader: follow change in cConfigurationReader::KeyValue interface

2020-10-16  Attila Torok

	* routing: Use new parsim partitioning arguments in campaign launch scripts

2019-06-20  Andras Varga

	* routing: NetBuilder: Exploit more permissive initialize(). There is no need
	to initialize newly created modules one by one: after NetBuilder's
	initialize() built them and returned, initialization will simply
	continue with the new modules.

2020-11-24  Attila Torok

	* osg-satellites: Remove support for osgEarth < 2.6.0, as we require >=2.7.0 anyways.

2019-09-13  Andras Varga

	* petrinets: Initial public revision

2021-06-17  Andras Varga

	* dyna: Server: create modules using unique names

2021-03-26  Andras Varga

	* dyna: omnetpp.ini: display string tweak to demonstrate layout groups

2021-03-04  Andras Varga

	* queueinglib: Follow change: PerformFinalGC(), replace with code in the module
	destructor ~Fork().

2020-06-03  Andras Varga

	* cqn: parsim: omnetpp.ini and run scripts revised

	- the runparsim-* scripts are now generic (not tied to cqn), only the
	  cqn-* ones are
	- the scripts query the number of partitions from omnetpp.ini,
	  using the new "parsim-num-partitions" and "-e" switch
	- HOSTNAME no longer needs to be set, because the runtime reads it by
	  calling the gethostname() <unistd.h> function.
	- partitioning is now good up to 16 processes.

2020-01-06  ------ omnetpp-5.6 released ------

2019-11-11  Rudolf Hornig

	  e.g. not generate [0,1) and collect a histogram on [10,20)
	- added hint text on canvas
	- updated fingeprint tests

2019-01-24  Andras Varga

	* histograms: eliminate AutoRangeStrategyBuilder for code simplicity

2018-12-03  Attila Torok

	* histograms: Remove a lot of configs and histogram setups.
	As this sample is no longer used for fingerprint testing, there is no
	need to have it so complicated.

2018-07-02  Attila Torok

	* osg-indoor: Fix build when only OSG is installed, osgEarth is not.

2018-11-30  Andras Varga

	* aloha, queuenet: Fix: unit can no longer be omitted in zero values

2019-04-26  Patrik ThunstrÃ¶m

	* osg-earth: Add ifdefs to support osgEarth version 2.10.0 and above
	where the annotations API has been refactored.

2018-07-02  Attila Torok

	* osg-intro: Fix build when only OSG is installed, osgEarth is not.

2018-06-25  ------ omnetpp-5.4.1 released ------

2018-06-11  ------ omnetpp-5.4 released ------

2018-04-09  Attila Torok

	Packet mode in Qtenv.

2018-04-11  ------ omnetpp-5.3 released ------

2018-01-17  Andras Varga

2017-12-12  Andras Varga

	* aloha: Follow cPar longValue()->intValue() rename

2018-01-09  Andras Varga

	* routing: omnetpp.ini: cast from double to int now required explicit cast (int())

	* routing: NED files: fix: use int instead of double for parameters like width/height

2017-12-12  Andras Varga

	* routing: Follow cPar longValue()->intValue() rename

	* routing: Removed .intValue() calls and rely on the safer (overflow-checking)
	cast-to-integer operators instead

2018-02-15  Attila Torok

	* osg-satellites, osg-earth: Switch from ObjectLocator to GeoTransform. The former was removed
	after osgEarth 2.8, and the latter has been around for quite some
	time now.

2018-01-29  Pal Sipos

	* osg-earth: Replace and add new level 2 offline map tiles. Fixes black screen
	with osgEarth 2.5.0.

2017-09-18  ------ omnetpp-5.2 released ------

2017-06-19  Andras Varga

	* aloha: omnetpp.ini: Rename itervar 'mean' to 'iaMean'. The name was often
	confusing during analysis of the simulation results. (Without context,
	"mean" could refer to the mean of something, or to an operation
	computing the mean.)

2017-08-30  Andras Varga

	* resultfiles: Added Pandas tutorial

	* resultfiles: Refreshed result files (due to Aloha change and result file format changes)

	* resultfiles: Added some vec files from the Aloha project

2017-08-25  Andras Varga

	* routing: Added config for generating interesting output vectors for resultfiles/

2017-06-08  Attila Torok

	* osg-earth: Follow OMNeT++ API change: use cOsgCanvas::EarthViewpoint instead of
	osgEarth::Viewpoint.

2017-05-08  ------ omnetpp-5.1.1 released ------

2017-03-31  ------ omnetpp-5.1 released ------

2017-03-20  Rudolf Hornig

	store-and-forward routing. Default is store-and-forward.

	* routing: Refined the simulation configurations in omnetpp.ini

	* routing: Added parameter study to omnetpp.ini, to be used in samples/resultfiles

2017-02-13  Attila Torok

	  The routers are immediately forwarding the packets without storing them.
	  This allows showing the packets as arrows showing the actual length of the packet.

2017-02-06  ------ omnetpp-5.1pre3 released ------

2017-01-09  Attila Torok

	* aloha: Transmission figures now have descriptive names.

	* osg-earth: Add building model source to the offline .earth file.

2017-01-19  Attila Torok

	* osg-earth: Added an offline tile source package, and corresponding omnetpp.ini
	configurations. Levels 16, 17 and 18 are to be added in later to
	release builds from an overlay zip.

2016-12-20  Attila Torok

	* osg-earth: Create the transmission animation procedurally.

	It is no longer loaded from bubble.osgb. That file has been deleted
	because there were many issues loading it, with different versions of
	OSG, especially finding the animation in it. The spheres are now faded
	too, and are animated manually in simulation time rather than "real"
	(wall-clock) time by osgAnimaion.

2016-12-23  ------ omnetpp-5.1pre2 released ------

2016-11-21  Andras Varga

	* aloha: Animation/visualization code cosmetics.

2016-11-10  Attila Torok

	* aloha: Show circles in the transmission rings, new animation speed parameters.
	 - Animation speed is controlled by each node, taking three parameters for
	   different states (idle, transmission edge, midtransmission) into account.

2016-08-10  Attila Torok

	* aloha: Added transmission ring animations.
	 - The Server and all Hosts now have a fixed position (still random, but
	   deterministic, and not using auto-layouting) so their individual
	   propagation delays can be computed.
	 - Each transmitted packet is visualized with a ring and many concentric
	   circles, illustrating the workings of the protocol, including collisions.

2015-12-03  Andras Varga

	* aloha: Rewritten to use refreshDisplay()

2016-12-07  Rudolf Hornig

	* resultfiles: Updated result files (mostly renames)

2016-12-21  Rudolf Hornig

	* osg-satellites: Added WITH_OSGEARTH to the .cproject file so the IDE will show the osgEarth specific
	  code in enabled state.

	* osg-satellites: Replaced the discontinued MapQuest public tile source with a single offline image.

2016-04-12  Andras Varga

	* osg-satellites: Refactored mobility logic, some cosmetic changes to the code, added more comments.

2016-12-21  Attila Torok

	* osg-earth: Transmission animations are no longer loaded from a file, but created from code instead.

2016-12-21  Rudolf Hornig

	* osg-earth: Added WITH_OSGEARTH to the .cproject file so the IDE will show the osgEarth specific
	  code in enabled state.

2016-08-26  Attila Torok

	* osg-earth: Moved movement trails off the ground to avoid Z-fighting glitches.

2016-04-12  Levente Meszaros

	* osg-earth: Made mobile nodes more easily noticeable in the Boston streets configuration.
	 - Added modelColor parameter to MobileNode.
	 - Changed dumptrack model color to somewhat redish.
	 - Increased dumptrack model size.

2016-05-23  Rudolf Hornig

	* queueinglib: Fixed a race condition: PassiveQueue is now required to allocate
	the Server before sending a job to it.

2016-04-11  Andras Varga

	* canvas: Reverted the usage of refreshDisplay(), as it was not good here.
	Some random points were added to the movement trail in Fast and Express mode.

	* canvas: Prevented displaying the traveled distance using scientific notation.

2016-04-13  ------ omnetpp-5.0 released ------

2016-03-18  Andras Varga
