2022-04-11  ------ omnetpp-6.0 released ------

2021-05-05  Andras Varga

	* NED files updated for changed parameter reference semantics: Added "parent."
	qualifier to parameter/gate/submodule references where needed.

2021-04-19  Andras Varga

	* "Config " prefix in section headers is now optional, removed

2020-11-19  Attila Torok

	* Move initializers inline, remove empty constructors and destructors

2019-10-30  Rudolf Hornig

	* Use intval_t, uintval_t instead of long, unsigned long as long is
	not 64-bit on Windows.

	* fix: unit can no longer be omitted in zero values

	* Follow cPar longValue()->intValue() rename

2017-06-19  Andras Varga

	* omnetpp.ini: Rename itervar 'mean' to 'iaMean'. The name was often
	confusing during analysis of the simulation results. (Without context,
	"mean" could refer to the mean of something, or to an operation
	computing the mean.)

	* Transmission figures now have descriptive names.

	* Animation/visualization code cosmetics.

2016-11-10  Attila Torok

	* Show circles in the transmission rings, new animation speed parameters.
	 - Animation speed is controlled by each node, taking three parameters for
	   different states (idle, transmission edge, midtransmission) into account.

2016-08-10  Attila Torok

	* Added transmission ring animations.
	 - The Server and all Hosts now have a fixed position (still random, but
	   deterministic, and not using auto-layouting) so their individual
	   propagation delays can be computed.
	 - Each transmitted packet is visualized with a ring and many concentric
	   circles, illustrating the workings of the protocol, including collisions.

2015-12-03  Andras Varga

	* Rewritten to use refreshDisplay()
