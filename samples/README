This directory contains several simulation models to demonstrate the features
of the simulation framework. These simulations are intentionally kept simple to 
facilitate understanding, even at the cost of sacrificing some realistic 
details.

There is a step-by-step tutorial (TicToc), some queueing simulations (Fifo,
Queueing, CQN), many which borrow their topic from the field of
communication networks (Aloha, HCube, TokenRing, P-to-P, etc; the FDDI model
retired in OMNeT++ 3.4) and also some which show off certain features of the 
simulation framework (such as NEDDemo for topology description, and Hist for 
histograms).

The source code for all models are provided for you to study. While we have
done our best to comment the sources, it is probably necessary to browse
through the Manual before you try to understand them. You might also find
the simulation kernel API reference useful.

We suggest that you start your tour with the TicToc tutorial.
