2017-01-19  Attila Torok

	* Added an offline tile source package, and corresponding omnetpp.ini 
	configurations. Levels 16, 17 and 18 are to be added in later to 
	release builds from an overlay zip.

	* Create the transmission animation procedurally.

	It is no longer loaded from bubble.osgb. That file has been deleted
	because there were many issues loading it, with different versions of
	OSG, especially finding the animation in it. The spheres are now faded
	too, and are animated manually in simulation time rather than "real"
	(wall-clock) time by osgAnimaion.

	* Added WITH_OSGEARTH to the .cproject file so the IDE will show the osgEarth specific
	  code in enabled state.

	* Moved movement trails off the ground to avoid Z-fighting glitches.
