What's New
==========

This file summarizes OMNeT++ changes in each release. For changes related to
simulation model compatibility, see doc/API-Changes. For more detailed info
about all changes, see include/ChangeLog, src/*/ChangeLog, and ide/ChangeLog.

OMNeT++ 4.6 (Nov 2014)
----------------------

IMPORTANT:
    To install OMNeT++ on OS X, you must install both the Apple Java 
    support package (http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572) and (Oracle) JDK 1.7 
    or later (from http://java.com).

Tkenv:

  - Improved zooming/panning support: use double click to zoom in around
    a point, and Shift + double click to zoom out; use Ctrl + left mouse
    button to drag out a rectangle to zoom to (a.k.a. marquee zoom;
    implementation based on patch from Christoph Sommer), right-click
    cancels marquee zoom; use left mouse button for panning

  - Further small UI fixes (see ChangeLog)

Core:

  - The testing tool opp_test has been revised and is now an official part
    of OMNeT++.

  - The Manual now has a new chapter that covers the testing of simulation
    models as well as the usage of the opp_test tool.

  - The message compiler opp_msgc was reimplemented as a part of nedtool.
    opp_msgc still exists as a wrapper script that points to nedtool.

IDE:

  - The IDE is now based on Eclipse 4.4 Luna, and requires JDK 1.7 or later.

  - The IDE is now a 64-bit application on Mac OS X.

Other:

  - OMNeT++ is now using C++11 by default (-std=c++11) when models are compiled.
    The simulator itself does not use any of the C++11 features, so C++11 support may
    be disabled in configure.user. Update your models to compile properly using the
    C++11 standard, as later OMNeT++ versions will require C++11 compliance.

  - OMNeT++ can be configured to use the 'omnetpp' namespace by setting
    USE_NAMESPACE=yes in configure.user

  - Clang compiler support: Clang is used by default on OS X, and can be turned
    on on Linux. Clang is still not supported on Windows (we are waiting for the
    MSYS Clang packages to mature).

  - The bundled MSYS/MinGW toolchain was updated to use MSYS2. MSYS2 resolves
    a number of issues:
    - No more memory errors during build
    - The make command now properly supports parallel build (-j4, -j8 etc.)
    - The bundled MSYS2 toolchain now contains the pacman package manager,
      so you can install additional packages if you wish
    - Change in OMNeT++: The msys/ directory has been moved to tools/win32/, and
      the mingw/ directory that contains the compiler has been moved to 
      tools/win32/mingw32/.

OMNeT++ 4.5 (June 2014)
-----------------------

Tkenv:

 - The Tkenv GUI has been redesigned for single-window mode to improve
   usability and user experience. Tkenv has also received a new, modern look
   and feel, due to the use of the Ttk widgets and a custom Ttk theme.

   Details:
   - single-window mode, with object navigator + 3 built-in inspectors
     that interact in a meaningful way (new inspector windows can still
     be opened)
   - keep inpector windows on top of the main window at all times
   - use Ttk widgets everywhere, with custom theme - this makes a huge
     difference in looks on all platforms but esp. on OS X
   - BLT no longer needed (we use Ttk instead)
   - inspectors are no longer tied to a single object; visited objects
     are remembered as navigable history (back/forward)
   - module graphics now remembers zoom level and settings per NED type
   - for each log line, the context module is now stored, and is shown
     as a line prefix where it makes sense (differs from event's module)
   - Tkenv now stores message sendings and also a clone of corresponding
     message objects (cMessage), and can show them in the log window
   - message printer classes can be contributed to customize the
     messages view of log windows
   - more concise status area that shows more information at the same time
   - part of the status area can be turned off to free up vertical space
   - timeline drawing now adapts to font size
   - on-demand scrollbars (i.e. they are hidden when not needed)
   - main menu cleanup (reorganized, removed obsolete items)
   - dialogs where it makes sense now remember size and location
   - additional hotkeys: Ctrl+Plus/Minus for Zoom, Ctrl+F5 Run Until,
     Ctrl+Q Quit, etc.
   - OS X: use Command key for hotkeys instead of Ctrl
   - countless other, smaller improvements

Other:

  - In the Windows bundle, the debugger have been upgraded to gdb-7.7;
    Tcl/Tk has been upgraded to version 8.6.0.
  - New configure.user option to prefer clang over gcc if both are installed
  - New configure.user option to enable/disable C++ 11 compilance (-std=c++11)
    Note that this is NOT supported on Windows because of issues with the bundled
    MinGW 4.7 compiler.
  - Tcl/Tk version 8.5 is required, 8.6 is preferred; BLT is no longer in use


OMNeT++ 4.4.1 (Feb 2014)
------------------------

Bugs fixed: http://tinyurl.com/omnetpp441-fixes


OMNeT++ 4.4 (Dec 2013)
----------------------

Sim:

  - Support for optional signal checking. When signal checking is turned on,
    signals emitted by modules/channels must be declared with a @signal property
    in the module's or channel's NED description; undeclared signals will result
    in a runtime error. Signal declarations are of the form

        @signal[<signalName>](type=<dataType>).

    <signalName> may contain wildcards (?,*). Type is optional; if present,
    data type can be long, unsigned long, double, simtime_t, string, or a
    registered class name. To allow NULL pointers, append a question mark to
    the class name. Example:

        @signal[receivedPk](type=cPacket?);

    This feature is controlled by the check-signals=<bool> configuration
    option, and it is turned off by default for now.

  - Support for @statistic-style declarative result recording on dynamically
    registered signals (e.g. "conn-<n>" where n is an integer). Instead of
    @statistic, add a @statisticTemplate property in the NED file, and for
    each new signal call ev.addResultRecorders(...).

  - Support for programmatically adding result filters and recorders on
    signals: cResultRecorder has been revised to allow result recorders
    to be used without a corresponding @statistic attribute, e.g. they
    can now be added to signals programmatically.

  - Further signals-related changes:
    - added emit(simsignal_t, const cObject*) to cComponent
    - added receiveSignal() overload for bool to cIListener
    - introduced SimsignalType which replaces the older cITimestampedValue::Type
    - added cObjectFactory::isInstance() method that effectively wraps a
      dynamic_cast
    - added Register_Abstract_Class() macro that allows abstract classes to be
      used in signal declarations as type.

  - Added cNEDValue::parseQuantity()

  - New result filter: removeRepeats

  - Feature: Just-in-Time debugging support. It adds the following new
    configuration options: debugger-attach-on-startup=<bool>,
    debugger-attach-on-error=<bool>, debugger-attach-command=<string>,
    debugger-attach-wait-time=<time>. When any of the first two options are
    set to true, the simulation kernel will launch an external debugger
    attached to the simulation process at the appropriate time. The default
    debugger on Linux is Nemiver.

NED:

  - More freedom in NED property syntax: (1) Hyphens, dots and colons are now
    allowed in property names and indices; and (2) values no longer need
    to be enclosed in quotes if they contain parens, provided that parens are
    balanced.

Tkenv:

  - Feature: Animation filters (right-click on any message, and select
    "Exclude messages like '...' from animation" from the context menu.)

  - Feature: "Debug Next Event" (Ctrl+F9). It causes the simulation program
    to stop in the debugger just before entering the handleMessage() call.

  - Fixes and workarounds for various issues on Mac OS X (poor animation speed,
    missing icons on OS X Mavericks, hang on the F5 key, etc.)

  - Fix: the "Filter Window Contents" dialog could lose state

  - Source cleanup (consistent naming style for Tcl procedures)

IDE:

  - Use Eclipse 4.3 as base platform

  - Support for project-specific images: icons from the "images/" folder of the
    project and its dependencies are automatically used by the NED editor, and
    added to the Tkenv image path when the simulation is launched. (The folder
    name is currently hardcoded; it will become configurable in future versions.)

  - Sequence Chart: Fixed bug that caused including the same reuses multiple times.
    Fixed error handling when the error occurs in paint during startup.

Improved support for C++11, Mac OS X:

  - The source now compiles without any warning with both gcc and clang, using
    the "-std=c++11 -Wall" flags (clang is the default compiler on OS X since
    version 10.9 Mavericks).

  - Added proper support for cross-compilation using ./configure --host=i686-w64-mingw32

  - Updated install instructions for OS X 10.9 Mavericks. Specifically, gdb is
    no longer distributed with OS X; users are expected to install it themselves
    from MacPorts, and digitally sign it.

  - IDE: fixed the launcher not to throw error if the toolchain is clang.

  - Updated the source to compile with both Bison 2.3 and 3.0

Bugs fixed: http://tinyurl.com/omnetpp44-fixes


OMNeT++ 4.3.1 (Sept 2013)
-------------------------

The IDE was made more friendly to first-time users:

  - When the IDE is started with an empty workspace (e.g. on first-time
    launch), it offers the user the following options: (1) Import the OMNeT++
    sample simulations into the workspace; and (2) Download and install the
    INET Framework.

  - The latter function is also available via the Help > Install Simulation
    Models... menu item. The menu item brings up a dialog with the list of
    simulation models available for automated installation, and lets the user
    choose. Currently only the INET Framework is listed there, but it is
    planned to add further models.

  - When the IDE is started for the first time, it now displays some helpful
    introductory pages in the editor area: "Getting Started" (practical
    advice for getting past the first 10 minutes spent in the IDE);
    "At a Glance" (explains the common file types like NED, msg and ini, and
    their purposes); "OMNeT++ Samples" (describes each example simulation in
    two sentences, then provides links for opening the project, viewing the
    README, launching the simulation, etc.) These pages are also available
    from the Help system (except the last one, which has a dedicated menu item
    under the Help menu.)

Further IDE improvements:

  - IDE launcher script: fixed #670 (vmargs conflict between omnetpp.ini and
    the launcher script). This bug could cause IDE crashes by PermGenSpace
    exhaustion.

  - Analysis Tool, Output Vector View: show "Go to" actions in the context
    menu (instead of the view's pulldown menu)

  - Analysis Tool: fixed #389 (Useless items in the Statistic Name filter):
    The filter hints of combos is now computed from the result items filtered
    by the other 2 combos.

  - Analysis Tool: fixed #388 (add '*.host[*].*' variant to module filter hints)

  - Ability to import sample projects even if workspace is different from
    omnetpp/samples

  - Trying to launch a closed project will now offer opening it

  - NED documentation generator: fixed #672 (Illegal group reference error)

  - Changed default appearance of the main welcome page to be more user
    friendly

  - Some other bug fixes


OMNeT++ 4.3 (March 2013)
------------------------

IDE:

  - Updated to Eclipse 3.8.2.

  - The CDT debugger no longer stops at the main() function by default.

  - The bundled GDB has been downgraded to 7.4, due to problems with the one
    in the 4.3rc1 version

Tools:

  - The configure script now correctly detects the X headers on Mac OS X 10.8.


OMNeT++ 4.3rc1 (Jan 2013)
-------------------------

IDE:

  - Analysis tool: added support for computed scalars. Read the updated the
    User Guide for further details.

  - Analysis tool: added 'Logarithmic X axis' option to scatter chart.

  - Added NED editor support for named channels.

  - Added support for opening files from the command line, i.e. use:
    $ omnetpp Aloha.ned

  - Added full screen mode (Ctrl-Shift-F11).

  - Usability improvements in the Analysis Tool.

  - Better error reporting in the Sequence Chart and Event Log views.

  - The CDT C++ code analyzer has been turned off as it was reporting
    too many false positives.

  - The IDE has been switched over to use CDT's DSF debugger instead of
    the older CDI.

  - The IDE no longer runs the C/C++ Indexer before build (the code now
    collects the information for makefile dependency generation by other
    means)

  - Added pretty printing of STL containers (std::map, etc), simtime_t
    and other objects to the debugger; see the updated User Guide for
    details.

  - Updated the bundled MinGW (GCC, linker and GDB).

  - Updated to Eclipse 3.8.1; the IDE now requires Java 1.6+.

NED:

  - Added named channels support, e.g. "...<--> eth1: EthernetChannel <-->...",
    with the purpose of making it easier to address channel objects when
    assigning parameters from ini files. Channel definitions can now specify
    a default name (via the @defaultname property), too.

Sim:

  - Added the cPatternMatcher and cMatchExpression utility classes to the API.
    cPatternMatcher is a glob-style pattern matching class. cMatchExpression
    builds on top of cPatternMatcher and lets you combine patterns with AND,
    OR, NOT for matching fields of arbitrary objects.

  - Added hasEncapsulatedPacket() to cPacket.

  - Implemented calculateWeightedSingleShortestPathsTo() in cTopology.

  - Signals implementation now allows static initialization of simsignal_t
    variables.

  - Fixed a bug in Expression where '-2m' was evaluated to '2' (meter was lost)

Tools:

  - The simulator now supports Mac OS X 10.8 (you need to install XQuartz; see
    the Install Guide)

  - Simplified makefile output: Makefiles now output only the filenames to the
    console instead of whole commands. This makes the build output less noisy.
    If you need the old behavior, use the 'V=1' (verbose on) option on
    the make command line.


OMNeT++ 4.2.2 (March 2012)
--------------------------

Bugs fixed: http://tinyurl.com/omnetpp422-fixes


OMNeT++ 4.2.1 (Jan 2012)
------------------------

Bugs fixed: http://tinyurl.com/omnetpp421-fixes


OMNeT++ 4.2 (Nov 2011)
----------------------

Several bug fixes.


OMNeT++ 4.2rc2 (Nov 2011)
-------------------------

Documentation:

  - Revised and significantly expanded the "C++ Development" chapter in the
    User Guide to better assist model developers; smaller improvements in
    other chapters

Tools:

  - Updated MSYS and MinGW binaries in the Windows distribution.

  - The build system now creates 64-bit binaries on Mac OS X 10.6 and 10.7
    (if your processor supports it). Previously the -m32 flag was added to
    the GCC command line to force the creation of 32-bit binaries. (This
    was necessary because earlier versions of CDT did not support 64-bit
    debugging).

  - Enabled pretty-printing of variables in gdb (see below)

IDE:

  - Better C++ debugging experience: std::string, std::vector, std::map and
    other standard classes as well as simtime_t are now displayed in a
    meaningful way; simulation objects (cObject) display their full paths.
    This functionality is enabled by gdb pretty printer extensions written
    in Python, and is thus available for command-line gdb debugging too.
    For activating the pretty printers, see misc/gdb/README.

  - NED documentation generator improvements: better-looking tables in the
    generated documentation; running Doxygen is now cancellable; etc.

  - Dropped PowerPC support for the IDE because Mac OS X 10.7 no longer
    supports this architecture.

Sim:

  - Refactored operator= and copy constructor in all classes. Now they
    delegate to the same function in the super class, and the common
    part of the two is factored out to private copy() functions.

  - Fixed all warnings to make it compile using -Wall -Werror.

  - Coroutines used for 'activities' are now implemented using the
    swapcontext() POSIX call (if it is available on the system).

Sample simulations:

  - Database example revived. It demonstrates using database as configuration
    source, as storage for output scalars and vectors, and as source of
    network topology. Currently it works with MySQL.

Countless bug fixes and smaller improvements.


OMNeT++ 4.2rc1 (Aug 2011)
-------------------------

Ini files:

 - Ini files: iterations (${...}) can now refer to other iteration variables,
   using the dollar or the dollar-brace syntax ($var or ${var}). This
   improvement makes it possible to have loops where the inner iteration range
   depends on the outer one. When needed, the default top-down nesting order
   of iteration loops is modified (loops are reordered) to ensure that
   expressions only refer to more outer loop variables, but not to inner ones.
   When this is not possible, an error is generated with the "circular
   dependency" message. Variables are substituted textually, and the text
   resulting from substitution is NOT evaluated except in the '<from>..<to>
   step <step>' syntax, and in the 'constraint=' ini file option. CAUTION:
   textual substitution means that variables in arithmetic expressions should
   be protected with parentheses. The text substitution model was chosen for
   greater flexibility as well as the ability to produce a more consistent
   semantics. See src/envir/ChangeLog for more details.

 - Incompatible change: In the constraint= configuration option, variables now
   MUST be referenced with the dollar sign ($foo or ${foo} syntax), and also
   be surrounded with parens (to ensure precedence after the textual variable
   substitution). For example, the expression x+y<10 must be changed to
   $x+$y<10, or for greater safety, to ($x)+($y)<10.

 - Parallel iteration: it is now supported to use named iteration
   variables and parallel iteration together (${foo=...!bar} syntax.)
   This was not supported previously.

 - Some iteration-related error messages have been improved to provide
   more context.

Sim:

 - Result filter/recorder interfaces and registration macros made public
   (moved to src/sim), so that users can contribute their own result filters
   and recorders. Files: cresultlistener.h, cresultfilter.h  cresultrecorder.h.
   Result filters have to be subclassed from cResultFilter or the more specific
   cNumericResultFilter or cObjectResultFilter base classes and registered with
   the Register_ResultFilter() macro; result recorders have to be subclassed
   from cResultRecorder or the more specific cNumericResultRecorder, and
   registered with the Register_ResultRecorder() macro. After that, the new
   filter or recorder can be used in the source= and record= attributes of
   @statistic, and with the **.result-recording-modes configuration option.

 - The Define_Function() macros have been renamed to Define_NED_Math_Function().
   For backwards compatibility, the old macro definitions remain, but issue
   a deprecation warning. Note that the preferred way of defining new NED
   functions is now the Define_NED_Function() macro.

 - The API for custom NED functions defined via Define_NED_Function() has been
   changed. cDynamicExpression::Value (the old value class) has been factored
   out to a new cNEDValue class. Data members are no longer public, they can
   be manipulated via various methods. NOTE: This change is NOT backwards
   compatible: user-supplied NED functions will need to be revised.
   Look at src/sim/nedfunctions.cc for code examples.

 - Measurement unit support: added "mps" (m/s) and "kmph" (km/h) as recognized
   units; changed "Kbps" to the more standard "kbps"; changed byte multiples
   notation to use the now-standard IEC binary prefixes: KB -> KiB,
   MB -> MiB, GB -> GiB, TB -> TiB. The latter changes affect backwards
   compatibility, i.e. you may need to update existing models.

Tools:

 - opp_run: bugfix: release-mode simulation models compiled as shared libraries
   could not be run using a debug-mode opp_run program (they either crashed
   or reported that a module was not registered with the Register_Module()
   macro.) As part of the fix, a new opp_run_release program has been
   introduced, and opp_run (which is now always compiled as debug) delegates
   to it when necessary.
      Due to makefile changes related to the fix, you may need to re-create the
   makefiles of your simulation when upgrading to OMNeT++ 4.2. (You only need
   to do that when working on the command line. The IDE automatically recreates
   the makefiles, so no action is needed on your part if you are using only the
   IDE.) See src/envir/ChangeLog for details of this change.

 - Implemented number filter expressions using multiple inputs for statistics source
   expressions. For example:

      @statistic[dropRate](source="count(packetDropped)/count(packetSent)");

 - opp_msgc: improvement: announcements and type definitions now observe
   whether they are above the namespace declaration (=outside the namespace)
   or below it (=inside the namespace). This change makes it consistent with
   cplusplus blocks that had this behavior for quite some time. A related
   improvement is that type lookup in namespaces has been modified to make it
   possible to use unqualified names when declaring fields. See
   src/nedxml/ChangeLog for details.

 - Akaroa support improved; samples/aloha/akaroa.ini was added as example

Documentation:

 - Several chapters in the User Manual have been updated; especially, the
   Message Definitions section was turned into a separate chapter, and
   was completely revised.

IDE:

 - Upgraded to Eclipse 3.7

 - Added Eclipse Marketplace to the Help menu. You can now install
   additional features from the market.

 - Before running the simulations, the IDE will show the command line in
   the console view to help you execute the same simulation from the
   command line.

 - Ctrl-Tab now works on freshly opened NED files even if you do not explicitly
   select a simple module. In that case, the IDE opens the .h and .cc files
   associated with the first simple module in the NED file.

 - Improvement on the Manage Build Configurations dialog: newly created build
   configurations are now configured, by copying the source entries from one
   of the existing build configurations.

 - Project Makemake Options property page: overhaul for better usability.

 - Documentation generator: turn on JAVADOC_AUTOBRIEF in newly generated
   doxy.cfg files. (When this option is on, there is no need for @brief
   in C++ doxy comments; instead the first sentence of the comment is taken
   automatically as brief description.)

 - Bug fixes on: IDE makefile generator; the Project Features feature;
   the Inifile Editor (hover info, content assist, etc); the NED editor
   (display string proposals for connections and channels, etc.); Organize
   Imports feature; NED documentation generator; Simulation Launcher (e.g.
   launching folders with simulations in them works again);

 - SVN support removed from the IDE. It had very few users, and can be
   installed from the Market if needed.

 - Removed Animation Player as it was only a "technology preview" bundled
   with the beta releases to gather feedback from the user community. The
   animator is scheduled to appear in the next major OMNeT++ release.


OMNeT++ 4.2b2 (May 2011)
------------------------

Most important feature: "Project Features" (see below).

NED:

 - Added support for conditional submodules. Syntax:

     udp: UDP if needsUDP {...}
     tcp: <tcpType> like ITCP if needsTCP {...}

 - Added the xml() NED function, which accepts a string argument and parses
   it as XML. Its most notable use is eliminating "empty.xml" files from INET:
   one can use xml("<root/>") in NED files instead.

 - Implemented default value for parametric submodule and channel types.
   NED now supports the following syntax:

     mobility: <default("NullMobility")> like IMobility;

   The effect is that the NullMobility NED type will be used for the mobility
   submodule if the type name is not specified otherwise, e.g. in the config-
   uration with something like

     **.mobility.type-name = "ConstSpeedMobility"

 - Added the firstAvailable() NED function, which is helpful with the Project
   Features feature (see below). It accepts any number of strings (see new
   varargs support for NED functions), interprets them as NED type names
   (either short names or fully qualified names), and returns the first one
   that exists and is also "available" (its C++ implementation class exists).
   Example usage:

     tcp: <default(firstAvailable("TCP_lwIP", "TCP_NSC", "TCP"))> {..}

   It chooses the TCP_lwIP, TCP_NSC or TCP module type for the tcp submodule,
   in this order, unless the type is explicitly defined to be something else
   in the configuration.

 - Parametric submodule type can now also be specified in NED files, using
   patterns that end in the new "typename" keyword. An example:

     network Net {
         parameters:
             host[*].tcp.typename = "TCP_lwIP";
         ...
     }

Ini files:

 - The "type-name" per-object configuration option (**.typename=) has been
   renamed in to "typename", for consistency with the similar new NED feature.

Sim:

 - Implemented varargs support for NED functions. If the signature (see
   Define_NED_Function() and Define_NED_Function2() macros) ends in ", ...",
   then the function will accept any number of additional arguments of any type.
   At runtime, the implementation has access to both the actual number and
   types of args. When passing extra args, optional arguments (those marked
   with '?' in the signature) must all be present, i.e. varargs can only come
   when all typed args are there.

IDE:

 - Upgraded to Eclipse 3.6.2

 - Implemented the "Project Features" feature, which makes it possible to
   disable unused parts ("features") of a project to reduce compilation time
   and complexity. It has been invented to help INET Framework users and
   developers deal with the growing size of the framework. Features are
   described in the project's .oppfeatures file, authored by INET developers.
   Users can activate/deactivate features in the Project Features page of
   the Project Properties dialog (this page is directly accessible from the
   Project menu and from the Build Configurations submenu of the project's
   context menu in Project Explorer). Features map to NED packages and C++
   source folders; disabling a feature maps to NED package exclusion, and
   folder exclusion in CDT (C++ Development) configuration. Features can also
   define C/C++ symbols (for #ifdefs), and extra libraries to link with.
   At build time, the IDE checks the project's configuration (NED, CDT) and
   if it is inconsistent with the selected features, it offers fixing it.
   Features can also be used from the command line by exporting Makefiles
   (or opp_makemake commands) that reflect a particular enablement of features.

 - Support for excluding (disabling) NED packages. This feature is needed for
   the Project Features feature. Exclusions can be edited on the NED Source
   Folders project property page, and are saved into the project's .nedfolders
   file.

IDE/Animation Player:

 - Implemented lazy loading of the eventlog file: the tool can now animate
   large eventlog files with acceptable performance.

 - Animation effects refined, e.g. packet transmission on a datarate channel.

 - Heavy bugfixing. Note that the tool is still being actively developed, and
   it is generally not yet ready for everyday use.

IDE/Inifile Editor:

 - Usability: the editor now comes up with the page (text or form) that was
   used last time, and not always with the form editor. (When you flip the
   editor to the other page, the page type is stored in the preferences.
   When an editor is opened, the setting is read from the preferences and
   the corresponding page is activated.)

 - Improved text hover (F2) and hyperlink (Ctrl+click) support: the editor
   can now show information and go to the definition of modules that occur
   in the inifile key. For example, for a **.host[*].tcp.sackSupport = true
   line, the user can hover over (or Ctrl+click) the host[*] part, and the
   editor will show relevant information and go to the definition of the
   host[] submodule vector in the NED network description.

 - Improved content assist: per-object configuration options are now filtered
   by the type of object that the key refers to; for example, if you type
   **.ppp[*].txPkBytes.<Ctrl+Space>, the editor will know from the NED files
   that txPkBytes is a statistic, and offer completions accordingly.

 - Content assist: different types of completions (modules, parameters,
   statistics, configuration options, etc) are now marked with icons.

 - Markers on included inifiles are now removed when the main inifile is
   closed. (Fix for #176)

 - Added the Copy action to the Module Parameters view context menu: you can
   now select the key for an unassigned parameter in the view, and copy/paste
   it into the editor area.

IDE/Wizards:

 - New Tictoc Example and New Source-Sink Example wizards: fix: the root
   Makefile executed opp_makemake in the src/ folder at each build,
   overwriting the IDE-generated Makefile.

 - New OMNeT++ Project wizard template: now it is possible to set "custom make"
   for a folder: specify <foldername>:CUSTOM in the makemakeOptions= template
   variable in template.properties. Use "." to name the project root folder.
   Example: makemakeOptions = .: CUSTOM, src: --deep -meta:recurse...

 - New option for template.properties: preRunTemplate=<fti-file-name>. Example:
   preRunTemplate = main.fti. The option causes the given template file to be
   evaluated for its side effects, just after the user hits Finish but before
   any file is copied or template is evaluated. It is not allowed to produce
   text output, but the variables it sets will be substituted into other
   template.properties variables, and will also be available in other template
   files. (Note: all other templates are run in isolation, and cannot change
   variables for other templates!) The preRunTemplate option is the only way
   to programmatically set the value of makemakeOptions and similar
   template.properties options.

IDE/Graphical Editor:

 - Switched back double-click behavior to Open NED Type action. The Properties
   dialog can now opened with Ctrl+Enter (Alt+Enter was unavailable.)

IDE/Sequence Chart and Event Log:

 - Added show/hide options for arrows that represent mixed dependencies.
   (Such arrows are drawn when the sequence chart is filtered, and represent
   e.g. a sequence of message sendings and self-messages)

 - Eventlog: enhanced performance of event tracing filter

 - Simulations now record the termination message and result code into the
   eventlog file

 - Note: eventlog file format has changed (in order to better serve the
   Animation Tool) -- .elog files recorded with any prior version of OMNeT++
   have to be re-recorded.

Many bug fixes, mostly in the IDE; you can see the detailed list at:

OMNeT++ 4.2b1 (Feb 2011)
------------------------

Partial list of changes since 4.1 (see ChangeLog files in individual folders
for a more complete list):

Simulation runtime:

 - Removed #include <winsock.h> from <platdep/timeutil.h>; the reason
   is that it conflicted with lwIP code recently integrated into INET.
   <platdep/sockets.h> still includes <winsock.h>, but now
   <platdep/sockets.h> (and <platdep/timeutil.h>) MUST precede <omnetpp.h>
   in all source files.

 - Ini files: implemented multiple inheritance for sections. Syntax:

     [Config Foobar]
     extends = Foo, Bar

   When the runtime looks for a config option or param assignment, sections
   are examined in a "fallback order" until the first match is found. In the
   above example the order would be: Foobar, Foo, Bar, General.
   OMNeT++ uses C3 linearization to compute the section fallback order,
   see e.g. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C3_linearization

 - Ini files: better parsing for iteration variables, e.g. the value in
   ${x=uniform(1,2)} is now parsed as one item, not as "uniform(1" and "2)".
   Nested parens/brackets/braces and string literals are recognized;
   escaping commas and close-braces is now possible using backslash.

 - NED: fixed deep parameter assignments: parameter references were
   interpreted in the wrong context. Deep parameter assignments are when
   an inifile-like pattern is used to name the parameter(s) to be set, as in:

      network Inet {
          parameters:
              host[*].tcp.nagleEnabled = true;
          ...
      }

 - Resolved spurious errors: 'Class "..." not found -- perhaps its code
   was not linked in, or the class wasn't registered with Register_Class()'
   Added a check to ensure that the debug and the release versions of
   the simulation library are not loaded at the same time. This problem
   occurred when a model was built as 'release' and the debug version of
   'opp_run' was used to start it. As a result, the simulation seemingly
   started but complained about missing classes.

 - Fix: Some classes were thrown out by the linker if OMNeT++ was statically
   built, and the simulation was complaining at runtime about the missing
   cCompoundModule class.

 - Eventlog recording: .elog file format change: message creations and
   duplications (cloning) are now recorded; MC (ModuleCreated) entries now
   precede GC (GateCreated) entries. IMPORTANT: The sequence chart in the
   IDE will only work on .elog files in the new format, existing event logs
   need to be re-recorded!

IDE/Animation Player:

 - This is a new component in the IDE, you can access it by right-clicking
   an .elog file and selecting "Open With / OMNeT++ Animation Player" from
   the context menu. This is a preliminary implementation (Technology
   Preview) not yet optimized for large files, the practical maximum file
   size it can handle is about 10MB.

IDE/C++ Development:

 - Added a new "Clean Local" item to the project's context menu that does
   not clean referenced projects. This resolves the problem that CDT's
   "Clean Project" command also cleans the referenced projects, e.g. if
   you have a Foo project that depends on INET, cleaning Foo also cleans
   INET which takes a long time to recompile. Now you can use the
   "Clean Local" command to clean Foo only.

 - Added new "OMNeT++ Code Formatter" profile. This coding convention follows
   the rules used in the OMNeT++ kernel and the INET Framework. (No tabs, etc.)

 - Added MachO64 binary parsers and error parsers. This makes it possible to
   debug a 64-bit executable on Mac OS X 10.6

 - Linux only: Added support for profiling with Valgrind. To activate this
   feature, select "Profile as... / OMNeT++ Simulation" from the Project
   Explorer context menu. This feature requires Valgrind to be installed
   on your system. (Note: the main IDE toolbar does not show a Profile button
   next to the Run and Debug buttons at this time, but profiling is still
   available via the Project Explorer context menu.)

 - The Makemake page in Project Properties can now fix the "Source Folders
   differ across configurations" problem in the project setup, which usually
   occurs when you add a build configuration to an existing project later.
   The dialog now displays a "Fix it" link.

IDE/Graphical Editor:

 - Several performance optimizations for the NED Editor. It can open much larger
   files than before. NED validation is done now in a background thread and
   does not block the UI.

 - Select 'NED Type Selection' dialog now works correctly on first open. It
   shows the defining projects for the types.

 - Enhanced drag and drop capabilities in NED Graphical Editor. You can
   drop NED types into a compound module either to create submodules
   (if you drop it into the submodule area), or to turn it into
   an inner type (if you drop on the title of the compound module).

 - The Graphical Editor now displays the file's package name at the top.

 - Graphical Editor displays self-connections as arcs in the module's upper
   right corner.

 - The resize/move feedback figures have been changed from a simple outline
   to translucent blue.

 - Added a 'Properties' dialog that can edit one or several objects
   at a time, and allows you to change graphical and type information.
   It also has a preview panel.

 - Enhanced editing of type fields in the 'Property View'. The editor correctly
   enumerates the possible choices and adds an import statement if necessary.

 - 'Open Type' and 'Open Supertype' have been reassigned to the F3 function key.
   Double-click now opens the 'Properties' dialog.

 - The IDE now uses the use native (C++) layouter code for placing unpinned
   submodules, which means better performance and consistency with the
   simulation runtime (Tkenv).

IDE/Inifile Editor:

 - Support for inifile improvements in this release, namely multiple section
   inheritance and better parsing for iteration variables

 - Performance improvements: inifile is now analyzed in the background so that
   it does not block the UI, and features that need its results (hover text,
   content assist, etc) have a timeout how long they are willing to wait for it
   (see bug #132 for details). It is now also possible to disable inifile
   analysis. Further performance and UI responsiveness improvements are planned.

IDE/Sequence Chart:

 - Added 'Go to Simulation Time' and 'Go to Event Number' in the context menu.

 - 'Go to Simulation Time' in the 'Event Log' view now supports relative values.

 - The Sequence Chart tool now knows about message creations and duplications
   (cloning), and as a result, in certain situations it is now able to better
   identify relationships between events and draw a better sequence chart.
   NOTE: Due to changes in the .elog file format, the tool will only work with
   newly recorded files. Existing event logs need to be re-recorded!

IDE/Launcher:

 - The command-line for launching the simulation now uses relative paths instead
   of absolute ones. This makes the starting command-line easier to understand.

IDE/Documentation Generator:

 - Added tilde notation as an alternative to automatic hyperlinking of module
   names in comments. The latter was often too aggressive (e.g. linking to the
   IP module in the phrase "IP address" is wrong). Automatic hyperlinking can
   now be turned off in the generator, and then the user is expected to mark
   words to be hyperlinked with a tilde: "the ~IP module". The INET Framework
   has already been converted to use the tilde notation.

 - Added Javascript to autoload frameset page if a content page is opened by
   itself. This is useful when URLs to specific content pages are posted on
   the mailing list or sent over email.

 - Implemented @include in NED comments. Lines in the included file don't have
   to start with "//", but otherwise they are processed exactly as NED comment
   text.

 - Fix: External pages (@externalpage) now appear under the "Selected Topics"
   node of the navigation tree in the generated documentation.

 - Several minor fixes: recognize the <u> (underline) HTML tag; sanitize the
   file names for @page; added/refined test cases

Tkenv:

 - Parallel simulation: Placeholder modules are now displayed with a semi-
   transparent icon (or if it's a rectangle or oval, with dotted border).

 - Fix (bug #248): compute coordinates (and sizes) in double and not int;
   necessary if background scaling (bgs display string tag) is set up.

 - Better choice of default user interface font, especially on Linux.

 - The generic UI font and the font used in graphics are now configurable
   in the Simulation Options dialog.

 - The default font for log text is now proportional (same as the generic UI
   font), for better readability and space efficiency. It can be customized
   (switched back to a monospace font, etc) in the Simulation Options dialog.

 - Minor: menu items have been changed to title case

 - Tcl errors are now logged into .tkenvlog instead of dumping them on stdout.

Misc:

 - Added -g option to 'scavetool scalar' command. You can specify how the
   scalars are grouped into columns/variables.

 - The build system can now build large projects on windows. The 32K command-line
   limitation has been resolved.

 - Updated base system to Eclipse 3.6.1

 - Added a detailed IDE change log file doc/IDE-Changes

Several bugs have been fixed; you can see the detailed list at:
http://tinyurl.com/omnetpp42b1-fixes


OMNeT++ 4.1 (June 2010)
-----------------------
Changes after 4.1rc2:

 - Testing on various Linux distros, updated Installation Guide

 - Simulation error messages now contain the event number and the simulation
   time

 - Tkenv: contents of simulation error dialogs are now inserted into the
   main window as well, for reference and easier copy/paste

 - Various bug fixes


OMNeT++ 4.1 rc2 (June 2010)
-------------------------------
Simulation kernel:

 - cChannel: added forceTransmissionFinishTime(simtime t), so that
   channels can support aborted transmissions (needed e.g. for Ethernet).

 - cChannel: added getNominalDatarate(). This is often needed in models,
   for example in INET to fill in the interface entry.

 - added forgetXMLDocument(filename) and flushXMLDocumentCache() to
   cEnvir (see bug #131)

 - cPar: added a note to the xmlValue() method that the lifetime of
   the returned objects may be limited. Modules should NOT hang on to
   cXMLElement pointers between events!

Envir:

 - Ini file inclusion now behaves as textual substitution: if an included
   ini file does not contain [General] or [Config XXX] lines, the file's
   content will be treated as if copy/pasted into the section containing
   the include. Ini files that do not start with a section heading will
   now be accepted and treated as if they started with [General].
   Rationale: allow factoring out orthogonal pieces of config into
   separate files.

IDE:

 - Added support for the `m` tag on connections allowing to set the preferred
   directions of a connection between a submodule and its compound module.

Misc:

 - various fixes on Tkenv, the IDE and the build system


OMNeT++ 4.1 rc1 (May 2010)
--------------------------

Partial list of changes since 4.1b4 (see ChangeLog files in individual folders
for a more complete list):

Simulation kernel:

 - Enter_Method_Silent() may now take arguments (a printf-like arg list),
   and it logs the call into the event log file.

 - Re-added cChannel::calculateDuration() that was removed in 4.1b3

 - Fix: exponential(), normal(), truncnormal() and geometric() could produce
   +INF, due to log(dblrand()) in their code where dblrand() can produce zero.
   As a side-effect of the fix, the fingerprints of all simulations that use
   those distributions as input have changed.

NED:

 - New NED function: expand(). It substitutes ${} config variables into a string.
   Example usage in a NED parameter:
   string fileName = default(expand("${resultdir}/${configname}-${runnumber}.txt"));

MSG:

 - Implemented @sizetype property for array fields; it can be used to specify
   the C++ type of the array size and array indices (by default it is unsigned
   int).

 - Fix: A "using namespace" line inside a cplusplus {{...}} block confused the
   parser.

Tkenv:

 - Implemented bilinear filtering for image/icon resize in Tkenv.

 - Simulation Options dialog: layouting algorithm can now be chosen
   from Fast, Advanced and Adaptive (default: Adaptive)

 - Implemented minimum icon size, resize window on layout and auto-adjust zoom
   options. New controls in the Simulation Options dialog:
    - "[] Resize window to fit network with current zoom level first"
    - "[] Adjust zoom so that network fills window"
    - "Minimum icon size when zoomed out (pixels)"

 - Added hotkeys for zoom in/out: Ctrl+N and Ctrl+M. Ctrl+N was already
   used by "Toggle module name", it was reassigned to Ctrl+D.

 - Improvements on the classic ("fast") layouting algorithm

 - Application icon for Tkenv

 - Several bug fixes (see ChangeLog)

IDE:

 - Analysis Tool: charts now support a much higher zoom level

 - NED Documentation Generator: generating full inheritance and usage diagrams
   can now be turned off (they were often too busy to be useful)

 - Several other bug fixes


OMNeT++ 4.1 beta 4 (April 2010)
-------------------------------
Simulation kernel:
 - Added statistics to the built-in channel types, ned.DatarateChannel and
   ned.DelayChannel. They are not recorded by default; recording can be turned
   on with "**.channel.result-recording-modes = all" in the configuration.
   DatarateChannel records the following: busy state (as vector);
   utilization (time average as scalar); number of packets (as scalar);
   number of bytes (as scalar); number of packets discarded in channel
   disabled state (as scalar); throughput (bps, as scalar). You can see the
   declarations of these statistics by running "opp_run -h neddecls".

 - handleParameterChange() is now called for each component with NULL
   as the parameterName after the last stage of the initialization phase.
   This allows the components to refresh their cached parameter values
   if some parameters were changed during the initialization phase.
   Existing code needs to be updated to accept name=NULL and interpret
   it as "any parameter".

 - signals framework: changes in the cIListener interface since the previous
   beta; changed cTimestampedValue class (which is used to emit a signal for
   statistics purposes with a different timestamp than the current simulation
   time) to support all data types

 - histogram classes: added getters getNumFirstVals() and getRangeExtension-
   Factor(); for integer histograms, cell boundaries are now at whole numbers,
   not halfs; implemented dup(); default number of cells changed

 - cChannel's process() method (which was introduced in the previous beta)
   was renamed to processMessage()

NED:
 - Inner types can now refer to the parameters of their enclosing type.

 - Statistics recording: introduced the source= key within the @statistic
   property, which lets you use a derived value as statistic. For example:
   @statistic[dropPercent](source=100*dropRatio;record=vector,last),
   where dropRatio is a signal emitted from the module. This feature also
   lets one emit message or packet objects as signals, and record some
   property of them as statistics. For example:
   @statistic[bytesSent](source=packetBytes(pkSent);record=sum).

 - The @signal property can now be used to declare signals, for example
   those that can be used as source for @statistic. An example:
   @signal[pkSent](type=cPacket).

 - Introduced optional statistic recording modes: now you can add optional
   items to the record= key of the @statistic property, by appending "?"
   to them. For example: @statistic[eed](record=vector?,histogram?,mean).
   By default, only non-optional items are active; optional ones can be
   turned on with **.result-recording-modes = all (see below).

 - Implemented the @dynamic property. When a submodule is marked with @dynamic
   or @dynamic(true) inside a compound module, the submodule will not be
   instantiated at network setup; rather, it is expected that it will be
   instantiated at runtime, using dynamic module creation. A module created
   this way will pick up parameter values from the submodule declaration in
   the NED file as well as from the ini file. @dynamic submodules are
   displayed in the graphical NED editor as semi-transparent, but otherwise
   can be edited (and configured in the inifile editor) like other submodules.

Envir:
 - The result-recording-mode= configuration option was renamed to
   result-recording-modes=.

 - result-recording-modes now has support for optional recording modes (those
   marked with "?" in @statistic(record=..), see above). The value "default"
   selects non-optional modes from @statistic(record=..), and "all" selects
   all of them. The list can be fine-tuned by adding recording modes prefixed
   with "+" or "-" (for "add" and "remove", respectively). A lone "-" disables
   all recording modes. Some examples:
     **.result-recording-modes = default,+vector,-histogram
     **.result-recording-modes = all,-vector
     **.result-recording-modes = last
   The first one selects non-optional recording modes plus records everything
   as output vector, but disables histogram recording. The second one selects
   all recording modes but disables vector recording. The third one only
   records the last value from all statistics. There are further examples in
   src/envir/ChangeLog.

 - Created a result filter and result recorder API, for filters/recorders
   that can be used in the source= and record= keys of @statistic.
   Result filters must subclass from ResultFilter, recorders subclass from
   ResultRecorder; classes must be registered with the Register_ResultFilter()
   and Register_ResultRecorder() macros.

 - New command-line options: -h neddecls prints the NED declarations for
   built-in types (ned.DatarateChannel, etc); -h resultfilters and -h
   resultrecorders prints the list of available result filters and
   result recorders (such as min, max, mean, timeavg, last, histogram,
   vector, packetBytes, packetBits, etc).

 - Result file change: integer histograms are now marked with "attr type int"
   instead of "attr isDiscrete 1" in output scalar files.

IDE:
 - NED editor: added banner comment for module/channel types created
   graphically

 - Ini file editor usability: more specific names for table columns in form
   editor; split "Output Files" page into "Result Recording" and "Event Log"
   pages in form editor

 - Analysis editor: separate horizontal and vertical zoom controls;
   more usable context menu for charts; result file reading made more
   robust (better error messages on errors); at the same time, removed
   support for reading old-style (3.x) vector files

 - Sequence Chart: more usable context menu; display of method calls and
   message reuse arrows turned off by default

 - Improved the display of @statistic and @signal properties in Module
   Hierarchy view

 - Dozens of bugfixes and other improvements

Tooling:
 - Updated MinGW and MSYS tools in the Windows distribution. The new MSYS
   now should work on Win64 (although the compiler still produces 32bit code).
   The GCC compiler is updated to a pre-release version of MinGW 4.5 (this
   solves the debugging issues on Windows platform).

Build system:
 - Extra long command lines are supported now for the MinGW linker. (Uses a
   temporary file to pass args to the linker if the command line is >32K.)

Tkenv:
 - It is now possible to turn eventlog recording on/off interactively, not only
   via omnetpp.ini options; see "Toggle eventlog recording" toolbar button.

 - Module initialization messages are now not printed; we added an option to
   turn them back on in the Simulation Options dialog.

Cmdenv:
 - Printing of module initialization messages is now suppressed in express mode

Bugfixes since beta 3:
 - in express mode, log messages (ev<<) were not recorded into the eventlog
 - NED graphical editor added explicit "ned.IdealChannel" to connections
 - NED editor failed to add blank lines between components created graphically
 - pack/unpack error for "long long" type fixed (on MinGW compiler)
 - fixed (reduced) the size of filter text field in the NED editor palette
 - Go To C++ Definition in NED file is working again
 - opp_test: %subst to understand backrefs ($1) in the replacement string
 - many other bug fixes


OMNeT++ 4.1 beta 3 (March 2010)
-------------------------------
Simulation library:
 - New channel programming model. The user needs to override the process()
   method of cChannel, which has the following parameters: the message;
   the time the message will reach the source gate of the connection; and
   a reference to a struct (cChannel::result_t) in which the method should
   return the results. result_t fields to be filled in are the propagation
   delay, the transmission duration, and a flag to indicate whether to model
   that the message got lost in the channel (when this is set, the simulation
   kernel will delete the message after process() returns).

 - New class: cHistogram. It is a merger of cDoubleHistogram and cLongHistogram
   (which have been kept for compatibility). cHistogram can work in "integers"
   or "doubles" mode; the difference is that in "integers mode", cell boundaries
   will be chosen to be integers. The default behavior is to automatically
   choose the mode after precollecting some (by default 100) observations.
   The significance of cHistogram is that the "histogram" recording mode
   of the new statistics framework (see below) uses cHistogram in its default
   setup.

 - New statistics recording framework using signals. The module's C++ code
   emits statistics as signals, and collector objects are attached externally,
   by the simulation framework. Statistics are declared in NED files using
   @statistic properties, and actual recording (whether to record values as
   output vector, or as histogram, or the average/minimum/maximum etc value
   as scalars) can be configured from ini files. The runtime cost of
   statistics that are not recorded is minimal, which allows module authors
   to emit lots of statistics in the code, and let the end users decide which
   statistics they want to record and in what form. Earlier, such functionality
   would have required extensive C++ programming in module.

 - Added a simTime() NED function that returns the current simulation time.
   simTime() makes it possible to create time-dependent distributions, e.g.:
   interArrivalTime = exponential(simTime()<10s ? 0.5s : 2s)

Envir:
 - New configuration option: warmup-period. This is associated with the new
   statistics recording framework: when specified, values produced during
   the first X seconds of the simulation will not be calculated in the
   results. For existing statistics that are calculated manually inside
   modules and recorded e.g. as recordScalar() in finish(), the module C++
   code of course needs to be modified to respect the warmup period; the
   length of the warmup period can be obtained from C++ code as
   simulation.getWarmupPeriod().

 - New configuration option: result-recording-mode (renamed to ~-modes in
   beta4); this option specifies what to record from statistics declared
   in NED. Example value: vector,histogram,timeavg,min,max.

 - New configuration option: debug-statistics-recording. When turned on,
   the simulation program will dump what result recorders have been attached
   to which module signals.

 - Renamed "vector-recording-interval" configuration option to
   "vector-recording-intervals" (plural) which is a more precise name, plus
   more consistent with eventlog-recording-intervals.

NED:
 - New properties associated with the statistics recording framework (above):
   @signal defines a signal emitted by the module, and @statistic defines
   a statistic that is available for recording. (A statistic can use a signal
   "as is", or can be some function of it; for example, a signal can be
   a packet, and a corresponding statistic can be the length of the packet.)

IDE:
 - The IDE is now based on Eclipse 3.5.2 and CDT 6.0.2.

 - Content assist for icons (with preview!), colors and other display string
   tags in the NED source editor. Content assist is now also supported
   for channel parameters, and @signal and @statistic properties.

 - Statistic and signal declarations are now shown in the Module Hierarchy view.

 - Content assist for statistics names in the ini file editor.

 - Several usability enhancement in the Analysis Editor:
   - SVG export for charts.
   - Redesigned filter interface on the Browse Data page provides more space.
   - Tree view in the Browse Data page: it shows results in a tree organized
     along runs, modules, results and result properties as tree levels.
     Tree levels can be freely configured.
   - Charts in the Chart Sheet are resized fill the editor window automatically.
   - The number of columns can be configured on the Chart Sheet.

 - Direct method calls can be visualized in Sequence Charts (needs to be
   turned on manually)

 - Generated NED documentation now includes signal and statistic declarations.

 - New FreeMarker template editor for editing of ".ftl" files, used for the new
   templated wizards feature (see 4.1b1).

Tooling:
 - The git package has been updated to version 1.6.5.

Documentation:
 - Extensive documentation review and proofreading.

Bugfixes since beta 2:
 - Fixed regressions related to parameter handling.
 - The IDE no longer crashes on multi-processor Windows machines.
 - git commands are working correctly now on Windows (git merge etc.)
 - The new version of Eclipse platform (3.5.2) solves the 'dead button' problem
   found on Linux systems with the latest version of GTK.
 - Documentation generator now correctly generates docs from NED files
   containing the @titlepage property.
 - Boolean parameters now can be recorded as scalars.


OMNeT++ 4.1 beta 2 (Jan 2010)
-----------------------------
API:
 - Added a "signal mechanism" to support emitting signals from a model. Signals
   can be used to decouple production of simulation results (statistics) from
   recording them, for model change notifications, publish-subscribe style
   module communication, and several other purposes. See the Manual for more
   information.

Simulation kernel:
 - Source files are now compatible with GCC 4.4 version.

 - Performance and memory optimizations.

IDE:
 - Result charts and sequence diagrams can now be exported in SVG format. This
   allows the creation of publication quality charts and diagrams.

Tooling:
 - The bundled MinGW GCC compiler and MSYS binaries have been updated
   to their latest version (on Windows).

Documentation:
 - A very detailed Installation Guide has been created. It provides step-by-step
   installation instructions for the most popular operating systems.

 - An IDE Developers Guide has been created that describes how to enhance the
   OMNeT++ IDE and extend it with new functionality.


OMNeT++ 4.1 beta 1 (Jan 2010)
-----------------------------

Simulation kernel:
 - Added setCapacity()/getCapacity() to cArray. setCapacity() can be used
   to trim back the internally allocated array after a large number of
   items have been removed from it.

 - cGate: added getNameSuffix() method.

 - FES performance improvement: cMessageHeap was changed to more efficiently
   handle the insertion and removal of events scheduled for the current
   simulation time. Such events are actually quite common due to plain
   (zero delay, zero datarate) connections between modules.

 - Performance improvement: cMessage::getArrivalTime() was consuming
   10-20% of CPU time in many configurations. Solution is return
   a reference (const simtime_t&) instead of a value.

 - Fixed cPacketQueue::remove() incorrect behavior when called
   with a packet that was not in the queue

 - Dynamic module creation: modules now pick up parameter values from the
   parent compound module's submodules section in the NED file. This will be
   useful with the @dynamic() submodule property (see later beta releases).

 - Fix: parse() and some other cPar methods did not cause handleParameter-
   Changed() to be called on the owner module

 - Many other bugfixes and improvements; see include/ChangeLog and
   src/sim/ChangeLog

NED:
 - Deep parameter assignments: it is now possible to assign parameters of
   sub-submodules, sub-sub-submodules, etc. from a compound module, using
   inifile-like wildcards. For example, **.tcp.mss=1024 may be used in a
   network NED file to configure TCPs inside all hosts in the network.
   This feature also involves a slight NED DTD change (doc/ned2.dtd).

 - Re-assigning a parameter that has an already assigned non-default value
   in an ancestor is no longer allowed.

 - Compound modules may now have a custom C++ implementation class,
   i.e. the @class() property is now understood for compound modules as well

 - Fix: operands of the '%' (integer modulo) NED operator now must be
   dimensionless (otherwise the result of truncation depends on the choice
   of the measurement unit)

Msg files:
 - opp_msgc: fixed namespace support. It is now possible to use types
   from other namespaces as base class, field type, or field enum.
   The src/nedxml/ChangeLog file contains some examples for this.

 - opp_msgc: improved cplusplus {{..}} blocks: their contents can be placed
   into or outside the namespace {...} block in the generated header file,
   depending on whether the block occurs before or after the namespace
   declaration in the msg file.

 - opp_msgc: removed support for enum inheritance (which was an undocumented
   and generally unused feature, with several issues)

 - opp_msgc: the message compiler can now be used to generate reflection info
   (cClassDescriptor) for existing classes. If you add @existingClass(true)
   into a message/class/struct, opp_msgc will not generate code for the class,
   only a descriptor object. (Corresponds to -Xnc command-line option.)

 - opp_msgc: generating descriptors can also be controlled via properties now.
   @descriptor(false) instructs opp_msgc not to generate a cClassDescriptor,
   and @descriptor(readonly) instructs it not to generate field setters into
   the cClassDescriptor. (Corresponds to -Xnd, -Xns command-line options.)

Envir:
 - When parallel simulation is enabled, host name and process ID will be
   included by default in the output file names.

 - A related fix: host name and PID are now inserted before default file
   extension instead of appending them at the end.

IDE:
 - The IDE is now based on Eclipse 3.5.1 and CDT 6.0.1.

IDE features:
 - NED editor:
    o adaptive palette: items with matching @labels properties and those
      already in the compound module are shown at the top
    o palette filtering: easily accessible text field to filter palette
      contents (case insensitive substring search)
    o when creating connections, connection chooser now offers connections
      with matching gates, using @labels properties of gates
    o new parameter editor dialog for channels and modules
    o completion proposals for connection parameters
    o visual feedback for multiple and conditional connections
    o better validation of NED files in the editor

 - Parameter grouping in the Module Hierarchy view

 - The simulation launcher now checks for errors (and warns if any) before
   launching simulations

 - Sequence Chart: attaching vectors to axes made more intuitive

 - Analysis Tool: many chart sheet and chart usability enhancements

IDE extensibility:
 - Support for easy creation of templated wizards that can contribute to
   the New OMNeT++ Project, New OMNeT++ Simulation, New Simple Module,
   New NED File, etc. dialogs. Such wizards are simple text files inside
   the templates/ folders of OMNeT++ projects. Wizards for creating wizards
   have also been provided. Templated wizards is one of the killer features
   of OMNeT++ 4.1. Read the IDE Customization Guide for further info!

 - Automatic discovery and activation of Eclipse plugins dropped into the
   plugins/ folders of OMNeT++ projects. This allows easy deployment of
   project-specific IDE extensions. Check the IDE Developers Guide for more
   information.

Tkenv:
 - Two-way connections are now rendered as a single line (without arrows)

 - Enhanced connection layouting for modules with a large width or height.

 - Right-clicking on a point covered by several objects now brings up a
   popup menu that contains a submenu for each object under the mouse.
   Previously only the topmost object was accessible, making crowded areas
   hard to inspect.

Tooling:
 - Source files are now compatible with GCC 4.4 version (fixed missing #includes)
 - Updated MinGW GCC compiler to 4.4 (on Windows)
 - Updated MSYS binaries (on Windows)


OMNeT++ 4.0 (March 2009)
-------------------------
This is a major revision of the whole simulation platform, with fundamental
changes in nearly every component. Changes since version 3.4b2:

GUI:
  An Eclipse-based comprehensive simulation IDE has been introduced to replace
  the previous standalone GUI programs gned, scalars and plove. The IDE supports
  all stages of a simulation project: developing, building, configuring and
  running simulation models, and analyzing results. It also supports
  visualizing simulation execution traces as sequence charts, and generating
  documentation. We are also bundling version control (cvs, svn, git) Eclipse
  plug-ins with the IDE. The IDE is supported on the three major platforms,
  Linux, Mac OS X and Windows. Since Eclipse is extremely extensible, we expect
  that OMNeT++-based simulation frameworks will contribute their own custom
  wizards into the IDE.

Tooling:
  On the Windows platform, we have standardized on using the MinGW compiler.
  We are bundling a version of MSys and MinGW with the distribution, along
  with MinGW versions of several open-source programs and libraries needed
  or found useful with OMNeT++, such as gdb, perl, libxml, gmp, graphviz,
  Tcl/Tk, svn and git. MinGW was chosen over Cygwin because MinGW builds and
  uses libraries in the native Windows (MSVC-compatible) binary format, and
  builds programs that execute without a Unix emulation layer. The MSVC
  compiler is only supported in the commercial version of OMNeT++.

Build system:
  In order to facilitate working with large simulation models like the INET
  Framework, the makefile generator opp_makemake has been extended with the
  --deep option. With --deep, opp_makemake generates a makefile that takes
  care of building a whole source directory tree.

  Another big change is out-of-directory builds for both the OMNeT++ libraries
  and simulation models: object files and other by-products of the build
  process go in a separate directory tree (out/).

  Simulation models can now easily be compiled with debug/release compiler
  options, simply with the commands "make MODE=debug" and "make MODE=release";
  there is no need to modify configure.user.

Simulation kernel:
  Simulation kernel internals have been redesigned with memory efficiency in
  mind, to support large-scale simulations better. Techniques include string
  pooling (storing freqeuently occurring strings such as module, gate and
  parameter names only in one copy), shared parameter value instances,
  gate vector descriptors (gate name, type and size are only stored once
  for the whole gate vector), and optimal packing of object fields (e.g.
  packing several boolean variables into an unsigned int).

  The simulation kernel as a library has been made significantly easier to
  embed in other (non-OMNeT++) programs. The way of using the OMNeT++
  simulation kernel as a plain C++ library has been documented in the Manual,
  and two corresponding code examples have been added to the distribution.

  There have been several complaints about precision loss due to simtime_t
  being represented with the C type "double". In 4.0, double has been replaced
  with an int64-based fixed-point representation; the precision can be
  configured in omnetpp.ini as a power of ten, with the default being
  picosecond resolution (1e-12).

  Regarding the API, several functions have been given better or more
  consistent names, with the most visible change being that getter methods
  have been prefixed with the word "get". Migration of simulation models
  to 4.0 is assisted by scripts that perform this renaming (and several other
  adjustments) in the source code.

  cMessage has been split into a base cMessage plus a cPacket class.
  The bit length, encapsulated message and error flag fields have been
  moved to cPacket.

  Modules have now the possibility to receive nonzero-duration messages
  at the beginning of the reception; this is done by reconfiguring the
  gate object.

  sendDirect() calls now expect the propagation delay and transmission
  duration values in separate arguments; this was done to facilitate
  the animation of wireless transmissions later.

NED:
  The NED language has been revised and significantly extended. An overview
  of changes:

  The language syntax has been changed to make it more consistent. A migration
  tool is provided to convert old NED files to the new syntax.

  A Java-like package system has been introduced to make the language scale
  to large model frameworks and to prevent name clashes; NED files files are
  now read from directory trees listed on the NEDPATH.

  Channels have been made first-class citizens. They can have arbitrary
  parameters like modules do, and may have custom C++ implementation classes.
  Three predefined channel types have been created, ned.IdealChannel,
  ned.DelayChannel and ned.DatarateChannel.

  Inheritance is now supported for module and channel types. Derived modules
  and channels may add new parameters and gates, may set or modify parameter
  values and gate vector size, and (in the case of compound modules) may add
  new submodules and connections.

  Inner types are now supported. This is most useful for making channel
  definitions local to the network definition that uses them.

  Module and channel interfaces have been introduced, to make "like"
  relationships more explicit. Module and channel interfaces can be used as
  a placeholder where normally a module or channel type would be used, and the
  concrete module or channel type is determined at network setup time by a
  parameter. Concrete module types have to "implement" the interface they can
  substitute.

  Inout gates and bidirectional gates are now supported. In the C++ code,
  inout gates appear as (input,output) gate pairs.

  Parameters can now have default values. The default value can be overridden
  in the ini file. If the ini file does not assign any value to the parameter,
  the default values get used automatically.

  Support for arithmetic expressions has become more complete, e.g. string
  manipulation is also possible.

  It is possible to annotate module or channel types, parameters, gates and
  submodules with properties. Metadata can carry extra information for
  various tools, the runtime environment, or even for other modules in the
  model. Examples include display strings, parameter prompt string and unit
  of measurement.

  Default icons (in general, default display strings) are now supported.
  Display strings are represented as metadata annotation (@display property),
  which can be modified via inheritance.

Ini files:
  Instead of runs, named configuration sections were introduced in the ini
  file.

  The concept of "runs" have been refined to provide parameter study support;
  Ini files now can specify parameter ranges and the runtime is able to explore
  them. The notion of experiment, measurement and replication was introduced to
  help the general workflow of result analysis.

  Configuration options are now checked; mistyped configuration options are
  reported. Configuration options can be given on the command-line as well,
  overriding the values specified in the ini file.

  The new "fingerprint" ini file option allows for quick-and-simple regression
  tests. The fingerprint is basically a hash of event times and module IDs
  during the simulation, and it can detect if the simulation follows a
  different trajectory after a supposedly "harmless" code change.

Result analysis:
  The new result analysis tool in the IDE (which replaces plove and scave)
  supports the notion of experiments, measurements and replication. The IDE
  now stores all operations required to create a diagram or chart in a "recipe"
  file. It can recreate the charts and diagrams automatically after re-running
  the simulation or the whole experiment.

  The vector and scalar file format has changed to support the new features
  of the IDE. Vector files are now indexed for efficiency.


OMNeT++ 4.0rc2 (Feb 2009)
-------------------------
Improvements since rc1:

Documentation:
  - Significant work went into updating the Manual. The following chapters are
    either new, or have been rewritten or significantly expanded:
      3 The NED Language
      7 Building Simulation Programs
      8 Configuring Simulations
      9 Running Simulations
      10 Network Graphics And Animation
      11 Analyzing Simulation Results
      15 Plug-in Extensions
      16 Embedding the Simulation Kernel
      17 Appendix: NED Reference
    Chapters that need further work are:
      4 Simple Modules
      6 The Simulation Library

  - Revised the User Guide. Text and screenshots have been updated to the
    current state of the UI.

IDE:
  - added the GIT plugin (now the IDE supports CVS, Subversion and GIT)

  - added the NED documentation generator. The generated documentation is
    under the Creative Commons license.

  - the IDE now generates GPL/LGPL/BSD copyright into newly created files;
    license may be declared by adding a @license property in package.ned

  - various bugfixes

Simulation kernel:
  There were several changes to make it easier to use the simulation kernel
  as a C++ library, to embed simulations into programs:

  - support for multiple instances of cSimulation. "simulation" is no longer
    a global variable but a macro that expands to cSimulation::getActive-
    Simulation(). Multiple cSimulation objects may coexist; before invoking
    any function in the simulation library, the correct cSimulation instance
    must be activated with cSimulation::setActiveSimulation().

  - one environment object per cSimulation instance. "ev" now maps to
    cSimulation::getActiveEnvir(), which is short for cSimulation::getActive-
    Simulation->getEnvir().

  - added cNullEnvir, a default do-nothing implementation for cEnvir, from
    which users can start subclassing their own custom environment objects

  - created cRunnableEnvir by factoring out run() method from cEnvir;
    simulation user interfaces like Cmdenv or Tkenv subclass from
    cRunnableEnvir, but other custom environment objects do not need to.

  - cConfiguration was split to a smaller cConfiguration plus a cConfigurationEx
    class that adds the rest of the methods. When the simulation kernel is
    used as library, only cConfiguration needs to be implemented.
    cConfigurationEx is needed only when one wants to plug in a different
    configuration object into the existing Envir library, replacing
    SectionBasedConfig.

  - find more details and examples in the manual, in include/ChangeLog,
    in src/sim/ChangeLog, and in the new sample simulations embedding
    and embedding2.

Samples:
  - added embedding examples

NED:
  - fix: channel types could not refer to local parameters ("this.param" caused
    an error)

  - refactored the registration of user-defined NED functions: added the
    possibility to register a documentation string (which gets printed in the
    "opp_run -h nedfunctions" output); cNEDFunction and Define_NED_Function()
    now expects the function signature in a C-like syntax.

Message files:
  - opp_msgc: improvement related to bug #33. Type *announcement* now can
    specify the base class of the declared class: "class B extends A;".
    To declare that the class does not have any base class interesting to
    opp_msgc, one must declare it as "extends void". See src/nedxml/ChangeLog
    for examples and more details.

Tkenv:
  - message display strings made consistent with module display strings: the
    "o" tag was removed, use "b=width,height,shape,color,borderwidth" instead.
    Also, a special color name "kind" has been introduced, which maps
    to a color depending on the message kind.

  - fixed bug #34: in Fast mode, bubble didn't get displayed for recently
    created modules

Cmdenv/Tkenv:
  - added -a option: lists all configurations and the number of runs in them

  - bugfixes: --repeat and --constraint command-line options were ignored
    when using -x option

  - on the command-line, accept per-object configuration options, also without
    object name pattern. Thus, both of the following are accepted, and are
    equivalent:
       opp_run --**.vector-recording=false
       opp_run --vector-recording=false

Tools:
  - added opp_runall tool

  - scavetool: renamed "summary" command to "list"; split the "filter" command
    into "vector" and "scalar" commands. The new "scalar" command can apply
    processing operations too. Currently it only supports the "scatter" operation,
    which creates a scatter plot dataset from the scalars.

  - opp_test: added a %extraargs option (was needed for new test/envir tests)

Packaging:
  - the Windows package now contains MinGW-GIT (the "git" command-line tool,
    and gitk). Please use the hyphen-less form of commands (e.g. git checkout
    instead of git-checkout).

Several bugfixes:
  - see http://dev.omnetpp.org/bugs/changelog_page.php


OMNeT++ 4.0rc1 (Dec 2008)
-------------------------
Improvements since beta 8:

General:
  - added the "opp" prefix to library names to prevent name clashes with
    other programs: liboppsim.so, liboppenvir.so, libopplayout.so,
    liboppcommon.so; oppsim.dll, oppenvir.dll, opplayout.dll, oppcommon.dll,
    etc.

IDE:
  - fixed the crash caused by static linking of libstdc++.so (bug #7)
  - improved stability of CDT integration
  - improved diagnostics: when simulation launch fails, Console View displays
    the command line, PATH, other environment variables, etc to help track
    down the problem.
  - several other bugfixes (see bugtracker)

Samples:
  - queueinglib changed to build a dynamic library, which is run using opp_run

  - added queueinglibext, which shows how to extend an existing model with
    C++ code from a new project

Tkenv:
  - reimplemented filtering, to fix poor performance and weird scrolling of
    log windows (bugs #16 and #17). The log is now stored in a memory buffer,
    and filtering re-fills the text widget from the buffer.

  - new feature: when you open a per-module output window, it comes up
    containing previous messages (and not empty as it used to). This
    feature was made possible by storing the log.

  - UI updates during Fast and Express Run changed from event-based
    (i.e. "every x events") to time-based ("every x milliseconds").
    Time only checked every 16 and 256 events though, respectively,
    to save CPU cycles.

  - implemented font selection for text windows and list controls

  - settings are now saved to $HOME/.tkenvrc, only inspectors are saved
    to .tkenvrc in the current directory. (Motivation: font selection is
    tyically meant to be global by the user, not per-simulation)

Cmdenv:
  - status updates in express mode are now time-based (every 2s by default),
    not event number based

  - other status update improvements: always autoflush status updates;
    print a final status update when simulation stops

Tools:
  - seedtool was renamed opp_lcg32_seedtool, and added a warning in its help
    that it is an obsolete tool and probably should not be used.

Several bugfixes:
  - see http://dev.omnetpp.org/bugs/changelog_page.php


OMNeT++ 4.0 beta 8 (Nov 2008)
-----------------------------
Improvements since beta 7:

IDE:
  - Makemake configuration made more flexible. Now any directory may contain
    a makefile, either generated or custom one. The corresponding property
    page was redesigned, and also moved to the OMNeT++ category (was under
    the C/C++ Build category). It is now also possible to export a makefile-
    creation script to support command-line builds. Note: syntax of the
    .oppbuildspec file changed (file written by 4.0b8 will not be understood
    by 4.0b7).
  - added Parameter Editor dialog as a field editor in the Property View
  - moved Cleanup NED Files command from the Navigation menu to the Source menu
  - several smaller fixes and improvements

Tkenv:
  - implemented module output window filtering: modules can be selected
    using a checkbox tree dialog. Bound to Ctrl+H.
  - implemented "Run until message", available in the Run Until dialog and
    in the context menu of message objects
  - event banner text revised, plus now includes message name and class
    as well; added "Short event banners" checkbox to options dialog
  - fixed popup menu behaviour on Linux (use tk_popup instead of post)

Other:
  - opp_makemake: generates separate target for each recursively invoked
    makefile. Several smaller fixes and improvements
  - beginnings of a regression test suite for opp_makemake: test/makemake.


OMNeT++ 4.0 beta 7 (Oct 2008)
-----------------------------
First public beta release of 4.0.


OMNeT++ 4.0 beta 1..6 (Mar 2008..Sep 2008)
------------------------------------------
Internal testing releases.


OMNeT++ 3.4b1/b2 (Nov 2006)
---------------------------
This release significantly improves Tkenv:
  - until now, Tkenv has been using various form-style inspectors to display
    the most important data members of objects. These inspectors have now been
    replaced with more comprehensive and consistent treeview-based
    inspectors.

  - broadcast animation has been implemented. When the feature is turned on,
    multiple send() or sendDirect() calls occurring within a handleMessage()
    call will be animated together, concurrently. This significantly improves
    the animation of wireless simulations. Note: the new animation mode
    implies that send/sendDirect calls are no longer animated at the
    place of the call as previously, but together at the end of processing
    the event (that is, after handleMessage() has already returned) -- that is,
    out-of-sequence with writing the log, for example. The broadcast animation
    feature can be turned off in the Simulation Options dialog.

  - implemented message filtering for the timeline, and improved on object
    filtering (Find/Inspect Objects dialog) by extending patterns with
    AND, OR, NOT operations and object field matchers.

  - implemented scrollback buffer limiting for event log windows (default is
    100,000 lines)

Simulation library:
  - several methods and classes already marked as DEPRECATED in their
    documentations and doc/API-Changes.txt are now marked as such, using
    GCC's __attribute__((__deprecated__)) facility, which results in warnings
    during compilation of code that uses them. Those pieces of code need to be
    changed in order to be compatible with future OMNeT++ versions.

  - opp_msgc was improved: as an experimental feature, class fields can now be
    annotated with properties of the form @propertyname(value). The following
    properties are accepted: field-level: @enum(enumname), @editable or
    @editable(true), @getter(methodname), @setter(methodname),
    @sizeGetter(methodname), @sizeSetter(methodname), @label(some-text),
    @hint(some-text); class-level: @customize, @omitGetVerb (or:
    @customize(true), @omitGetVerb(true)).

Other:
  - makefile improvements, from Laura Marie Feeney and Michael Tuexen.
  - the FDDI sample simulation has retired (it used lots of deprecated APIs)


OMNeT++ 3.3 (Oct 2006)
----------------------
This release contains several GUI enhancements in Tkenv, and several bugfixes.
Tkenv:
  - display string enhancement: connections with zero thickness set ("o=,0")
    now do not appear in the network graphics.

  - added object icons to inspector listboxes

  - added Run/Fast/Express buttons to every module inspector window, as well as
    a "Find/inspect messages, queues, etc within this module" button. These
    functions are all available via hotkeys too (F5,F6,F7,Ctrl+S).

  - added "Copy to clipboard" and "Save window contents" toolbar icons to all
    text windows. (Copy has already been available with Ctrl+C.)

  - main window position gets saved and restored

Bugfixes:
  - fix: gamma_d() was bogus for the alpha<1 case [reported by Patrick McDonnell]

  - fix: worked around a fiber-related Visual C++ problem that caused certain
    activity()-based modules crash when the simulation was restarted.

  - fixed a bug which sometimes caused Tkenv to crash when inspecting an
    internally refcounted message.

  - fixed a bug in Tkenv's setObjectListResult() [crash reported by Rodolfo
    Ribeiro Gomes and others]

  - fix: on some Linux systems, Tkenv used unreadably small font size in some
    dialogs

  - opp_msgc improvements: don't accept reserved words as identifiers; added
    OMNeT++ version check into generated code

  - fix: the simulation can now be in a directory whose path name contains spaces
    (e.g. "Program Files"); opp_nmakemake also fixed to accept include paths
    with spaces.

  - many other minor fixes and improvements; see the ChangeLogs of the
    corresponding source directories for more details.


OMNeT++ 3.2p1 (Jan 2006)
------------------------
This is a maintenance release. Changes include:
  - support for VC8.0 (Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 [Express]).
  - opp_nmakemake -b <dir> failed for directory names containing "++"
  - fixed bug in Plove/Scalars "Save picture" function


OMNeT++ 3.2 (Oct 2005)
----------------------
The following brief list wraps up the most important new features and
changes since the 3.1 release. Please read on to the sections about the
the prereleases (3.2pre1..4) for more details on these points, and for
a more complete list. Even more details can be found in the doc/API-Changes
file and the ChangeLog files of the individual source directories.

General:
  - support for database (MySQL) storage of: model topology, model
    configuration, output vectors and scalars and model topology.

Simulation core:
  - simplified the signature of simple module constructors; Module_Class_Mem-
    bers() is no longer required. Please check below or in doc/API-changes
    for backward compatibility information.

  - cleanup-time garbage collection turned OFF by default. It can be turned
    on manually, but the preferred way is to add proper destructors to
    simple modules.

  - implemented reference counting of encapsulated messages, primarily to
    increase the performance of wireless simulations.

  - WATCH() revisited: now its variants support STL container classes, and
    basically any data type that has operator<<.

  - modules can now get notified when a module parameter changes. Just redefine
    the new handleParameterChange(const char *parname) method of cModule.

  - several other API improvements -- see doc/API-Changes.

  - several opp_msgc improvements

GUI:
  - added the TimeBar to Tkenv, and made the "Find/Inspect Objects" dialog
    nonmodal (a long-standing wish).

  - several GNED refinements, the most visible one being that on opening a NED
    file it automatically tries to open all its imports as well (feature can
    be turned off).

  - big usability improvements in Plove and Scalars: Chart Settings dialog
    has been redesigned, and your custom settings can be saved as defaults.
    Plove also has new filters, and some problems got fixed in existing ones.


OMNeT++ 3.2pre4 (Sep 2005)
--------------------------
Simulation kernel:
  - cleanup-time garbage collection turned OFF by default. Simple modules
    have to deallocate all dynamically objects themselves, that is,
    proper destructors have to be added to every simple module class.
    Related new omnetpp.ini entries: perform-gc=<yes/no>, print-undisposed=
    <yes/no>.

  - added method cSimpleModule::cancelAndDelete(cMessage *msg) method, to
    facilitate writing destructors.

  - requirement for simple module constructors changed: they are invoked
    without args now. Module_Class_Members() is now unnecessary, but still
    accepted. See include/ChangeLog for details. All sample simulations
    have been updated accordingly.

    POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY: modules with handcoded constructors need
    to be modified. Add default values to constructor arguments:
    (const char *name=NULL, cModule *parent=NULL).

  - dup() method got moved to cPolymorphic, and return type changed to
    cPolymorphic. In the next release we'll drop MSVC 6.0 support,
    and move to covariant return types (which MSVC 6.0 doesn't support).

New examples:
  - database integration. With the given extensions, one can transparently
    redirect output vectors and output scalars into a MySQL database, read
    module parameters from a MySQL database (all without modification of
    existing models), or build a network from topology stored in a database.

Other:
  - NED: enabled parent module gates to get connected with "++".
    parentmodgate++ connects the first unconnected gate, but it doesn't
    create new ones -- it is an error to exceed sizeof(gate).

  - Precision in output vector/scalar files, that is, the number of
    significant digits printed can be set from the configuration now:
    [General] / output-scalar-precision=<int>, output-vector-precision=<int>.
    The default is 12, but it might not be straightforward to decide what
    is the "optimal" setting -- see src/envir/ChangeLog for a discussion.

  - configure script revised significantly: better detection of compiler
    (e.g. the Intel compiler is autodetected now); detection of linker
    flags needed for OMNeT++ models to be put into static/dynamic libs
    (-z allextract/--whole-archive, --export-dynamic); detection of "make"
    program (must be GNU make); improvement in detecting BLT and MPI.
    Now it also allows variables to be defined on the command line before
    running ./configure, as an alternative to configure.user.

  - nedtool and the preload-ned-files= omnetpp.ini entry now distinguishes
    between two types of listfiles, @listfile and @@listfile; the difference
    is in the interpretation of relative paths contained in the list file;
    see src/nedc/ChangeLog for details.

  - GNED: further improvements


OMNeT++ 3.2pre3 (Aug 2005)
--------------------------
Tkenv:
  - the "Find/Inspect Objects" dialog became nonmodal, and it can be kept
    open while the simulation is running.

  - added the "Run until next local event" command to modules' context menu
    (which pops up when you right-click an icon)

GNED:
  - reorganized and improved connection properties dialog (knows what gates
    submodules have, which gates are vectors, only offers output gates as src
    gate and input gates as dest gate, etc.)

opp_msgc:
  - "const fix": generate both const and non-const getter methods for fields
    of class or struct type.

  - it is no longer required to write out "fields:" in an otherwise empty
    class definition

  - added the possibility to set a base class field. E.g. kind=5 will
    generate the setKind(5) line into the constructor.

  - generate a protected and unimplemented operator==(), to prevent
    accidental usage of compiler-generated one

  - added the possibility (-P option) to declare generated classes to be
    dllexport/dllimport on Windows.

  - generated C++ header now contains relevant part of the .msg files as
    Doxygen comment

nedtool, dynamic NED loading:
  - don't look for the module type if the module vector size is zero

opp_nmakemake:
  - added options (-s, -t, -d) to enable building Windows DLLs from simple
    modules, plus -P option to support opp_msgc's similar option

Simulation kernel:
  - implemented reference counting of encapsulated messages. This should
    dramatically increase performance of wireless simulations, where lots
    of message duplication is done (AirFrames) with most copies discarded
    without looking into them (noisy channel or wrong L2 dest address).
    There' nominal (<1%) performance penalty for other simulations.

omnetpp.ini:
  - one can now use parameters like $MODULE_FULLPATH in the 2nd argument
    of xmldoc(), i.e. the paths expression to select part of an XML file
    to load. This allows for assigning XML params of several modules with a
    single line in omnetpp.ini. Consider the following:
      **.xmlConfig=xmldoc("all-in-one.xml","config[@mod=$MODULE_FULLPATH]")
    where all-in-one.xml contains <config mod="net.host1.rt">...</config>
    elements for every module.

  - also fixed some anomalies in the XML path expression interpreter.


OMNeT++ 3.2pre2
---------------
Simulation kernel:
  - WATCH() overhaul: now anything can be watched that has operator<<. If it
    also has operator>>, you can use WATCH_RW() to make it editable on the GUI.
    Objects and pointers to objects can be watched with WATCH_OBJ() and
    WATCH_PTR(). STL container classes can be watched via WATCH_VECTOR(),
    WATCH_PTRVECTOR(), WATCH_MAP(), WATCH_PTRMAP(), etc.

  - modules can now get notified when a module parameter changes. Just redefine
    the new handleParameterChange(const char *parname) method of cModule.

Tkenv:
  - flush omnetpp.vec every time the simulation is stopped (to enable looking
    at it with Plove to decide if simulation needs to be run longer)

  - added support for OPP_PLUGIN_PATH environment variable, and
    [Tkenv]/plugin-path= omnetpp.ini entry.

  - cGate inspector: channel attributes (delay, error and datarate)
    can now be changed from the GUI.

  - added support for custom items on the context menu (e.g. right-click
    on a router, "Inspect Routing Table..." Usage: place a .tcl file into
    the plugin path (./plugins by default) that calls the extendContextMenu
    Tcl procedure.

GNED: Michael Franzen contributed several improvements and fixes:
  - new option: "Open imported files automatically": tries to open all the
    files that are imported by an opened NED file. (It takes care that
    every NED file is opened only once.)

  - an "import path" can be specified, which is a list of directories
    where imported files are searched for (Andras)

  - new option: "Autoextend gates using gate++ notation". When this option
    is enabled (Options Menu), GNED does not generate "gatesizes" sections,
    and automatically uses the extension operator "++" on all gates that
    are connected. However, you always can use indices in the property page
    of modules to override automatic gate extension.

  - "Auto-calculate gate size": when switched on, this option generates
    "gatesize" entries for every gate of a module that is endpoint for
    indexed connections. The code searches for the maximum index of all
    connections ending at that port and generates the "gatesize" entry
    from that. If no indexed connection to the port is found, the
    "gatesize" entry is removed again.

  - "Set 'nocheck' for new modules": generates "connections nocheck" for
    all newly generated modules. This feature has a counterpart in the
    property page of modules: an "Allow unconnected gates" checkbox
    to enable/disable this feature for each module individually.

  - plus several smaller fixes

Heaps of small API improvements, see include/ChangeLog. A sample:
   - cOutvector: added recordWithTimestamp()
   - cDisplayString: setTagArg() now accepts numeric (long) arg too.
   - cMessage: if "vector" is a vector gate, msg->arrivedOn("vector")
     now checks if msg arrived one of the vector's gates.
   - cXMLElement: added getFirstChildWithTagName() and getNextSiblingBy-
     TagName()
Thanks to Michael Tuexen, Ignacio Arenas Jimenez and Wei Yang Ng who suggested
several of the above improvements.


OMNeT++ 3.2pre1
----------------
  - Plove and Scalars: improved Chart Settings dialog, and default settings
    can now be saved. New Plove filters, and fix in the winavg filter.
  - Tkenv: added Timeline Status Bar
  - Tkenv: fixed the r= display string tag (it displayed a circle half the
    specified size)
  - Tkenv: cMessage inspector now displays message size in bytes as well (not
    just in bits); also, it now displays time *until* arrival time (a delta)
    in addition to the absolute arrival time.
  - new cMessage member functions: byteLength(), setByteLength(), addByte-
    Length(). They just invoke the length(), setLength(), addLength() methods.
  - new utility function simtimeToStrShort()
  - fixed gcc-4 compilation errors, and removed -fwritable-strings compiler
    option
  - fixes and improvements on opp_neddoc
  - configure script now accepts NO_TCL=1 variable (for emergency use only)
  - opp_nmakemake: improved output of recursive build
  - Readme.MSVC updated on how to build DLLs from simple modules
Plus a number of smaller fixes, see the ChangeLogs in individual directories.
Documentation update is still TBD.


OMNeT++ 3.1 (Mar 2005)
----------------------
This release contains several bugfixes since 3.0, as well as new features
and new example simulations. To see a detailed list of problems fixed, check
the ChangeLog files in the various source directories. Thanks all of you who
have discovered and reported the problems.

A brief list of enhancements since version 3.0:

Real-time/hybrid simulation:
- Real-time simulation has been implemented, and it is demonstrated by the
  "Dyna/Real Time" sample simulation.

- An example for hybrid (hardware-in-the-loop) simulation is now provided,
  which is the "Sockets" sample simulation. It uses TCP sockets to communicate
  with the outside world -- in real-life applications this will probably need
  to be replaced with some other means of communication.

- In relation to the above: new methods got added to the cScheduler interface.

For Windows:
- Debug info (*.pdb) files have been included in the installer, so one can now
  single-step into the simulation kernel and user interface library sources
  while debugging.

Simulation library:
- New utility class: cStringTokenizer. It splits strings to "tokens" along
  given separator characters (by default spaces).

- Changed the way scheduled events or pending messages are handled when their
  destination module gets deleted during runtime. Before, these messages were
  deleted by the cSimpleModule destructor, but this made it very long to clean
  up large models. Now, messages are not deleted in the destructor, but left
  in the FES -- they will be discarded in cSimulation::selectNextModule() when
  they're met.

- cDisplayString's getTagArg() method was modified to never return NULL; it
  returns "" instead when the requested tag is not in the display string.

Configuration:
- Ini file runs can be given descriptions, and they will be displayed in the
  Tkenv run selection dialog. Just add the description="some text" line
  under the [Run x] headings.

- New omnetpp.ini entry to help debugging: [General]/debug-on-errors=
  true/false. If turned on, runtime errors (such as scheduling a message
  into the past) will cause the program to break into the C++ debugger
  if one is running, or just-in-time debugging is enabled. This makes it
  possible to investigate the context of the error (stack frames, variables
  etc). It works by doing INT 3 (debugger interrupt) on Windows, and
  raise(SIGABRT) on Linux.

- Slight change in the rules of handling included ini files, NED list files
  and all filenames mentioned in them. All filenames are now understood as
  relative to the location of the file which contains the reference,
  rather than relative to the current working directory of the simulation.
  This change is not backwards compatible, but has been found not to affect
  any of the simulation frameworks already ported to 3.0.

Tkenv:
- Implemented the "t=<string>,<color>" display string tag for connections.
  It makes the given string to appear near the connection arrow.

- Tooltips can now be added to submodule icons, connection arrows and messages.
  The tooltip text has to be given in the "tt=<tooltip-string>" display
  string tag, and will be displayed if the mouse rests over the component for
  a while. Tooltips allows more info to be displayed than can be squeezed
  into the "t=" display string tag.

- Added support for -r <run-number> command-line option, which has the same
  effect as (but takes priority over) the [Tkenv]/default-run ini file entry.

Misc:
- opp_makemake, opp_nmakemake: implemented -X option (ignore subdirectory
  during recursive build)

- The -h command-line option is now understood by both Cmdenv and Tkenv,
  and handled in a consistent way

- The place/ icon directory was renamed to misc/ (Please update display
  strings containing "i=place/..")

- nedc got removed from the distribution

Known problem: OMNeT++ windows have no Maximize button under recent
KDE versions. This is a known Tk+kwin problem which was fixed in Tk
early 2004.



OMNeT++ 3.0 (Dec 2004)
----------------------

The following list summarizes *all* changes since OMNeT++ 2.3:

- The simulation kernel has received an overhaul.

- A new step-by-step tutorial, revised documentation and several new
  sample simulations have been included to shorten your learning curve.

- Dynamic NED loading will cut model build time and simplify your work.

- Documentation generation tool will document your own large simulation
  models, and help you quickly get an overview about the structure
  of 3rd party models.

- The new Random Number Architecture features a modern, very long cycle
  Random Number Generator (Mersenne Twister) for more realistic simulation
  results, and RNG mapping for more flexibility in simulation experiments.

- Simulation models can now conveniently access XML configuration files
  for complex input.

- Plove now features a powerful interactive charting component, and also
  an internal data-flow engine for processing output vectors before
  plotting.

- The new Scalars tool complements Plove, and lets you analyze and plot
  scalar data produced by simulations.

- Support for Parallel Distributed Simulation

- Several Simulation GUI usability enhancements will save you time, and
  make your work more efficient.

- New icons, and enhanced animation capabilities (icon coloring, queue
  length display, status text, transmission range, transient bubbles,
  etc.) improve the overall look and feel of your models, give you more
  insight, and make the models instantly presentable.

- For better visualization of model dynamics, OMNeT++ now supports
  animation of direct message sending and C++ method calls across modules.

- The automatic network layouting using the SpringEmbedder algorithm will
  let you work with large networks in the GUI, without the need for
  individual positioning of nodes.

- Ready to receive your extensions: plug-in interfaces for new random
  number generators, new configuration databases and simulation event
  schedulers complement existing plug-in interfaces for recording simulation
  data, and let you implement custom input/output, real-time simulation,
  hardware-in-the-loop simulation and more.

Delta from 3.0 beta 1:

- User Manual revised

- Several bugfixes and new test cases, significant performance improvements
  in the network setup code; more intuitive error messages at places.

- The new <parametername>.use-default=true notation in omnetpp.ini makes it
  possible to apply the NED file defaults (specified via input()) to some
  or all unassigned module parameters.

- histogram classes (cLongHistogram, cDoubleHistogram) revisited


OMNeT++ 3.0 beta 1 (Nov 24 2004)
--------------------------------
- added new TicToc tutorial
- nedtool: implemented -h option (put output files into current dir, not source
  file's dir) [patch from Johnny Lai]
- Windows binary release contains 4 sets of libs now: vc6-debug, vc6-release,
  vc7-debug, vc7-release.
- several fixes and improvements


OMNeT++ 3.0 alpha 9 (Nov 3 2004)
--------------------------------
- fixed configure script problems in alpha 8

- new random number architecture: support for Mersenne Twister and Akaroa
  RNGs; unlimited number of RNGs; RNG mapping (module-local RNG numbers
  can be mapped arbitrarily to physical RNGs from omnetpp.ini. Details
  in src/envir/ChangeLog and on omnetpp.org.

- Tkenv fixes and usability improvements: (1) allow user interactions during
  message animation: animation speed can be changed with the slider, STOP
  button can be clicked, inspectors can be closed, etc;  (2) improved
  "Fast Run until next local event" function: now it always animates events
  that occur in the local module;  (3) fixed display string handling bugs: in
  "t=", commas and equals signs weren't handled properly.

- signatures of fullPath() and info() functions changed to use std::string.
  The new signatures are both safer (no danger of accidental buffer overrun
  or confusion caused by using static buffers) and easier to use.
  POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY: fullPath() calls in sprintf(), ev.printf(),
  new cException() etc calls should be changed to fullPath().c_str().
  (ev<< statements are not affected.)

- support for categorized icons (icons grouped into subdirectories with
  the bitmaps folder) in GNED and Tkenv

- linking problems (linker symbol conflicts) with recent Akaroa versions
  resolved


OMNeT++ 3.0 alpha 8 (Oct 2004)
--------------------------------
- in .msg files, struct fields can have initializers (a constructor gets
  generated)
- Tkenv: minor improvements
- configure script refinements


OMNeT++ 3.0 alpha 7 (Sept 2004)
-------------------------------
Several improvements and bug fixes since 3.0a6. Detailed list of changes:

- loading XML config files via "xml"-type NED parameters or
  ev.getXMLDocument(): If the document has an attached DTD (DOCTYPE
  declaration), the document will be validated, and attribute default values
  will be completed from the DTD.

- Scalars tool: enhanced Copy to clipboard functionality: different
  variables can be put on different columns. This makes it easier to use
  Excel's PivotTable or OpenOffice's DataPilot) functionality to analyze
  data.

- NED: gate vectors, if there's no "gatesizes:", will be created with zero
  size. (Previously they were created with size one -- this is a potential
  incompatibility.)  A zero-sized gate vector is internally represented by a
  single gate object whose size() method returns zero, and cannot be
  connected.

- Tkenv: bitmap path can now be specified in omnetpp.ini, using the
  [Tkenv]/bitmap-path= entry. Value should be "quoted", and directories
  should be separated by ";". The contents of the OMNETPP_BITMAP_PATH
  environment variable (or if that's not set, the compilation-time bitmap
  path) gets concatenated to this one.

  IMPORTANT: if you forget the quotes, ONLY THE FIRST DIRECTORY will be
  used with the rest ignored, because ";" is the comment mark in omnetpp.ini!

- opp_makemake, opp_nmakemake: facilitated creating makefiles which only
  have relative paths in them. The -b <basedir> option was added. <basedir>
  is supposed to be the toplevel directory of large multi-directory
  simulation model (such as IPSuite or MF). The -b option will cause all path
  names (passed with -I, -L, etc.) to be converted from absolute to relative.
  This means that makefiles will not need to be re-generated or edited when
  the project is compiled in a different directory.

- opp_neddoc: backslashing can be used to prevent intentional hyperlinking
  of a word which is also a component (e.g. module) name. That is, if you
  write "\IP", "IP" won't get hyper-linked in the HTML output, even if
  there's a module type called IP. Single backslashes will be removed from
  the HTML output -- double them if you want them to appear.

- opp_neddoc: on Windows, listing directories on the command line which had
  no .ned or .msg files in them caused opp_neddoc to stop with "file not
  found" error.


OMNeT++ 3.0 alpha 6 (Aug 2004)
------------------------------
POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY: because the resolution of "*" has changed (it no
longer matches "."), you may need to revise your existing omnetpp.ini files.

New features introduced in this release, in nutshell: enhanced wildcard
resolution in omnetpp.ini; direct support for XML config files via the "xml"
NED parameter type; Cmdenv now lets you choose which modules' ev output you
want to print; plugin interface for using configuration data sources other
than omnetpp.ini. Several improvements in opp_neddoc and opp_makemake, and
some bugfixes.

For more details, see article
  http://www.omnetpp.org/article.php?story=20040722133521209


OMNeT++ 3.0 alpha 5 (June 2004)
-------------------------------
Plove has been completely rewritten under the skin. It is no longer a wrapper
around grep, awk and gnuplot -- it boasts a powerful internal extensible
data-flow engine (for filtering and processing output vectors before plotting),
and a BLT-based plotting window (which allows a multiple plots via tabbed
window, and these plots are a bit easier to customize than gnuplot-based ones
were -- oh yes and they allow arbitrary zooming on the fly). The new Plove
can also do scatter plot. Calculating histograms and cumulative distribution
functions and various other refinements will come soon.

What else? opp_msgc now generates the pack/unpack operations so parallel
simulation has become a lot more transparent. Plus a couple of bugfixes of
course. The test suite (test/core) is supposed to pass completely, except
for one little known bug in ev<< w/ Cmdenv.


OMNeT++ 3.0 alpha 4 (May 2004)
------------------------------
This alpha release introduces a new tool, Scalars for analysing output scalar
(.sca) files. Scalars requires BLT. Another novelty is the new "control info"
field in cMessage which provides a better way to implement communication
between protocol layers than the traditional "interface packet" approach
used in older IPSuite versions. (IPSuite has also been switched over to employ
the control info approach.)


OMNeT++ 3.0 alpha 3 (March 2004)
--------------------------------
Bugfixes.


OMNeT++ 3.0 alpha 2 (March 2004)
--------------------------------
Improvements on opp_(n)makemake, Plove, Tkenv, parallel simulation; bugfixes.


OMNeT++ 3.0 alpha 1 (Jan 2004)
------------------------------
Sames as 3.0 Preview


OMNeT++ 3.0 Preview, 2004 January
---------------------------------
This is an intermediate code snapshot -- it was released to show you what
features are planned for release 3.0, and possibly to get early feedback
about them. It has not been fully tested.

The model documentation tool opp_neddoc has been introduced. It generates
fully hyperlinked documentation with diagrams from comments in .ned and .msg
files. It can also link to Doxygen-generated C++ documentation. It works both
on Unix and Windows.

Several Tkenv network animation enhancements: next event marker; animation
of sendDirect() and method calls between modules; message icons; auto-layouting
of networks; icon coloring; module "bubbles" (callouts); display of queue
length next to module icon; display of a status string above module icon;
optional modifier icon on top of submodule icon; submodule icon optionally on
top of a rect/oval; display of "transmission range"; color names in display
strings are accepted in HSB (hue-saturation-brightness) too.

Changing display strings was made more comfortable from simple modules.

Other Tkenv enhancements: powerful object search dialog; enhanced plugin
support (see test/tkenv/plugin); better tabnotebook and multi-column listbox
widgets via BLT. All Tkenv settings restored from .tkenvrc now.

New sample simulations: Tictoc (a step-by-step tutorial), Aloha, CQN (Closed
Queueing Network), Queueing, Routing, RoutingDB, Point-to-Point Transmitter.
Other changes are that Dyna and Dyna2, Fifo and Fifo2 was merged, Topo was
renamed to NEDDemo, Token renamed to TokenRing. The Nim example has finally
retired. The new/revised sample simulations demonstrate new Tkenv features
and also more simulation kernel features. They also mark a shift from
activity() based modules towards handleMessage()-based ones.

Dynamic loading of NED files has been implemented, which means it is possible
to use NED files directly, without nedc and C++ compilation. NED files
containing compound modules and networks can be loaded dynamically.
NED files can be loaded interactively (Tkenv "Load NED file" toolbar icon)
or automatically (via omnetpp.ini, preload-ned-files= entry). (alpha!)

Simulation kernel: internal object ownership handling, has been redesigned,
which both reduced memory footprint (sizeof(cObject)) and increased speed.
Another efficiency improvement is that for short object name strings,
the string is now stored inside cObject (and not dynamically allocated via
new char[...].)

Distributed simulation support rewritten, currently experimental. (alpha!)

Several new tests in test suite, also for testing opp_neddoc and Tkenv.

TODO:
The Manual is still to be updated at places. Further items are the
introduction of new RNG architecture based on modern RNGs, and testing
and completion of nedxml/nedtool (which will bring the retirement of nedc).


OMNeT++ 2.3 release (June 2003)
-------------------------------
A major revision of the User Manual has taken place. In addition to
documenting new features, several existing sections have been revised,
updated and expanded for clarity and informativeness, based on feedback
from the community.

Even if you already have a printed copy of an earlier manual, this is
a good time to discard it and print a new one -- even experienced OMNeT++
users will find a wealth of new information in it. For the list of
changes, see the "Document History" table at the front of the manual.

Deprecations! To ensure your simulation will be compatible with future
releases, please check doc/API-Changes.txt and remove use of
deprecated functions from you simulation models. Functions deprecated
now are likely to be removed in next major release.

Improvements:
- message subclassing: generated message classes now accept message kind
  in the constructor.

Bugfixes since 2.3b2:
- fixed problem with deleting dynamically created modules
- fixed opp_msgc problem with RedHat9's broken Perl (doesn't recognize [^\s]
  in regexps)
- minor improvements: opp_nmakemake now autodetects C++ file extension
  (.cc or .cpp); opp_msgc doesn't choke on -I flag


OMNeT++ 2.3b2 release (March 2003)
----------------------------------
This is a bugfix release. Resolved issues include:
- wrong handling of channels (bug was introduced in 2.3b1)
- opp_test failed on Unix if "." was not in the PATH
- various smaller bugs in GNED, Tkenv, Envir, and opp_nmakemake
- added several test cases (e.g. for channel testing) in test/

See doc/API-Changes.txt for the list of changes since 2.2, including those
that affect compatibility. ChangeLogs in respective source directories
contain even more details.


OMNeT++ 2.3b1 release (February 2003)
-------------------------------------
Licensing change: The license used in previous versions has been replaced
with a new "Academic Public License" (doc/License). This license gives
noncommercial users rights to use, modify and distribute copies of OMNeT++.
The possibility of using OMNeT++ under the GPL has been removed. Commercial
users of OMNeT++ should obtain a commercial license.

Major changes of this release in nutshell:
- The simulation kernel has been ported to use C++ exceptions and RTTI
  (Run-time Type Information) and on Windows, the Fiber API. Also, there
  has been extensive internal refactoring and refinement of the APIs.

- The "message subclassing" feature has been officially introduced. It is now
  documented in the manual, and used by several sample simulations.

- Added the implementation of several distributions: continuous distributions
  gamma, beta, Erlang, chi^2, student-t, Cauchy, triangular, lognormal, Weibull
  and Pareto; discrete distributions Bernoulli, binomial, geometric, negbino-
  mial and Poisson [contributed by Werner Sandmann and Kay Michael Masslow].

- Contains an alpha version of the new NED compiler architecture,
  built upon XML foundations. This includes a tool for generating
  documentation from NED files.

- Akaroa support. Akaroa does MRIP (multiple replications in parallel).

- Tkenv GUI has been polished -- both functionality and usability has been
  greatly improved. Plove GUI was also redesigned.

For the list of changes that affect portability of simulation models,
see the new doc/API-Changes.txt file. You can find even more detailed
information in the ChangeLogs of the respective source directories.

A more detailed list of changes follows:

Simulation kernel refactoring:
- On Windows, now Win32 native coroutines are used (Fibers API). This change
  made it possible to introduce the use of C++ exceptions.

- Error handling in simulation kernel (and in other libs too) has been ported
  to C++ exceptions. This not only resulted in cleaner kernel code, but also
  has benefits for you:
  * you can now use try-catch for better error handling. The API documentation
    describes which methods throw exceptions. The common exception class
    is cException.
  * methods like end(), endSimulation(), deleteModule() terminate the module
    immediately even when called from handleMessage(). In earlier versions,
    handleMessage() had to go through in any case.
  * you can now safely use C++ libraries that throw exceptions, e.g. STL.
  Methods like cSimpleModule::error() and opp_error() are remained for backward
  compatibility, but they simply throw cException. opp_warning() remained but
  its use is discouraged.

- Use of C++ RTTI (Run-time Type Information). From now on, you can use
  dynamic_cast<> in your code, and you don't need to provide a className()
  method in your classes (because the kernel can figure it out using typeid
  in the base class, cObject).

- Eliminated gcc 3.0.x warnings, and changed to the I/O headers <iostream>, etc.

- Several smaller auxiliary classes have been turned into inner classes of
  their respective 'main' classes. (For example, cQueueIterator became
  cQueue::Iterator, sTopoNode became cTopology::Node, etc; full list in
  include/ChangeLog.) Compatibility typedefs exist for the old names.

- Cleanup in cObject and cSimulation: several internally used methods have been
  eliminated or moved to better places. (For example, inspector-related methods
  cObject::inspector() and cObject::inspectorFactoryName() have been removed,
  and inspectors are now fully internal matter of Tkenv.)

- Refactoring on dynamic module creation: instead of modtype->buildInside(mod),
  one should now write mod->buildInside(), which is more natural.
  (The former syntax still works -- a cModuleType::buildInside() is still
  provided for backward compatibility). buildInside() delegates task to
  doBuildInside() (a new method), so it's doBuildInside() which should be
  redefined in subclasses, and also nedc generates now doBuildInside() code.

- Container classes are now more consistent in what they do when the requested
  object doesn't exist:
  * Convention 1: methods returning an object reference (e.g. cPar&) now
    always throw an exception if the object is not found. (Until now, some
    methods issued a warning and returned null reference, i.e. *(cPar*)NULL).
  * Convention 2: methods returning a pointer (e.g. cGate*) return NULL
    pointer if the object is not found. (Until now, some methods issued
    a warning and returned NULL pointer.)
  These conventions necessitated the following changes:
  * par() of cModule and cMessage now throws an exception if parameter was not
    found. (In simple module code, check for existence of a parameter before
    accessing it can now be replaced with try-catch.)
  * cModule: cGate *gate() methods no longer issue a warning if the gate is
    not found, just return NULL.
  * cArray::remove(cObject *) and cQueue::remove(cObject *) methods
    now return NULL instead of the original pointer if the object was
    not found.

- cPar can now use compiled expressions subclassed from cDoubleExpression (a
  new class). This is needed for code generated by the new nedtool.

- cSimulation changes:
  * lastModuleIndex() renamed to lastModuleId();
  * operator[] deprecated (use module(int) method instead)
  * del() renamed to deleteModule(); add() renamed to addModule()

- Channels are now represented by real objects (subclassed from cChannel)
  rather than parameters in cGate. Channels can be assigned to connections
  via cGate's setChannel() method; at the same time, DEPRECATED cGate's
  setDelay(), setError(), setDatarate(), setLink() methods (these attributes
  should be set on the channel object).

- cSubModIterator: operator[] deprecated (use operator()(int) method instead)

- For further, more internal changes and for more details on the above changes
  see include/ChangeLog and src/sim/ChangeLog.

Simulation kernel new features:
- Added convenience functions to cGate, cMessage, and cArray (see
  API-Changes.txt for details).

- A new utility class cDisplayStringParser lets you easily manipulate display
  strings.

Message subclassing, new NED compiler architecture:
- The Perl-based message compiler opp_msgc is now available in bin/. Message
  subclassing is documented in the manual, and it is demonstrated by several
  sample simulations. 40+ test cases deal with testing the generated code.

- Added nedtool, the new NED and message compiler (alpha). nedtool converts
  NED from/to XML, providing much better integration possibilities (for example
  it is now possible to use XML/XSLT to generate NED topologies from external
  data sources -- or to extract NED info to arbitrary XML format.)

- Added nedxml library (the library under nedtool) to src/, and its API-doc
  to doc/nedxml-api.

Manual:
- Manual source has been converted from Word to Latex [thanks to Ulrich Kaage
  for this non-trivial and time consuming task!]. He also added an Index.
  HTML conversion (using L2H, by myself) is not 100% yet, you should regard
  the PDF as the authoritative form.

- New chapter about message subclassing, plus various updates, fixes and
  clarifications [thanks to Phillip Feldman for his comments]

Build:
- In addition to Cygwin, the MinGW compiler is now also supported in Windows.
  Older Cygwin versions with the 2.95.x compiler cannot be used any more.

- Improved MSVC support: opp_nmakemake creates MSVC makefiles; running the
  test suite now works smoothly with MSVC; opp_stacktool displays reserved
  stack size for executables.

- MSVC projects now need *different* compiler flags. Every source should be
  compiled with exceptions enabled and using /GR, otherwise there will be RTTI
  exceptions. Because of the Fiber API, reserved stack size should be set to
  a low value, 64K.

- New utilities (Unix, MSVC): opp_neddoc creates HTML documentation for NED
  files; opp_neddocall creates HTML documentation for all nedfiles in a
  directory tree; splitvec to split output vector files.

- There are new targets in Makefiles that are generated by opp_makemake:
  Target neddoc.html generates a file named neddoc.html by using the
  opp_neddoc tool on all NED files. Target htmldocs generates HTML
  documentation of all source files (*.h and *.cc) using Doxygen. The
  HTML files are placed into the sub-directory ./htmldoc. Also, Makefile
  now generates ../doc/api/tags. This tag file can be included when generating
  model documentation.

- Improved configure script. Now we support Tk8.4, and also optional packages
  like Akaroa.

- Test suite: the number of test cases has grown from 19 to about 120 since
  omnetpp-2.2; now it covers a bigger part of the core functionality (modules,
  messages, queues, parameter) as well as message subclassing and some aspects
  of NED and Cmdenv. Tests for the distributions are in test/distr.

GNED, Plove:
- The Plove GUI has been redesigned, with focus on intuitiveness and usability.
  It also features icon toolbars, tooltips and more self-explanatory dialogs.

- The number of module icons available for simulations has grown from 41 to ~90
  since the 2.2 release. GNED also has an improved icon selector dialog now.

- There have been other small fixes and improvements in GNED, e.g. fixed the
  bug which caused display strings always being added to connections.

- All Tk GUIs now make use of the combobox widget from Bryan Oakley.

Envir changes (apply both to Cmdenv and Tkenv):
- Integrated Steffen Sroka's Akaroa extension that supports multiple
  independent replicated simulation runs.
  Akaroa can be activated by specifying
      [General]
      outputvectormanager-class=AkOutputVectorManager
  in the ini file. By default, all output vectors are under Akaroa
  control; the <modulename>.<vectorname>.akaroa=false setting can be used
  to make Akaroa ignore specific vectors. For more info see the Akaroa
  home page and the OMNeT++ documentation.

- Added fname-append-host=yes/no ini file setting. When turned on, appends
  the host name to the names of the output
  files (output vector, output scalar, snapshot files). This is
  useful when the simulation is run on multiple machines concurrently
  (parallel independent runs (Akaroa) or parallel/distributed simulation),
  and all running instances write to the same directory (e.g. shared
  via NFS mount). [Idea from Steffen Sroka's Akaroa extension]

- 2 bugfixes: (1) output scalar file did not get opened sometimes; (2) output
  scalar file got removed between runs

Cmdenv:
- Cmdenv can now display various performance measures like event/sec,
  event/simsec, simsec/sev, number of message objects, etc. during execution,
  so you can compare Tkenv and Cmdenv performances.

- The omnetpp.ini entries that control Cmdenv execution mode and amount of
  printed info have been changed. An express-mode=yes/no (default: no) switch
  has been introduced, with a meaning similar to Tkenv. Normal mode
  (express-mode=no) can be controlled with the module-messages=yes/no,
  event-banners=yes/no, and message-trace=yes/no entries (the third adds new
  functionality), while express mode is affected by the status-frequency=
  <num-events>, performance-display=yes/no entries. autoflush=yes/no has
  also been added. The display-update=, verbose-simulation= entries are now
  obsolete.

- The -h command-line switch now lists all networks and modules linked into
  the executable.

Tkenv:
- Inspector windows are now restored from a ./.tkenvrc file if you restart the
  simulation. More precisely: as soon as an inspected object (identified by
  fullpath and classname) gets created in the simulation, its window pops up.
  Objects must have unique names for this to work properly! [Thanks to Nicky
  Van Foreest for the idea]

- For better navigation of simulation objects, an object tree view has been
  added to the left side of the main window. It can be turned off from the
  toolbar for performance.

- Inspector windows have been re-though to make them more intuitive, consistent
  and informative. All inspector windows now feature an inspector bar with
  object fullpath, classname and pointer value (useful for debugging), and a
  color code to make it easier to match different inspectors of the same
  object. Axis labelling have been added to output vector inspectors.
  Added tooltips to graphical module inspectors, speeded up animation of on
  very long connection arrows, and refined functionality of the Step icon
  into 3 distinct icons ("Run until next local event", "Fast", "Stop").

- Improved File|New run and New network dialogs (now also available from the
  toolbar) offer choice from a combobox. Other improvements: main text window
  is now cleared when simulation is restarted; more tooltips & toolbar icons;
  better output in Message Trace window; increased event number status bar
  field width by 3 digits (it was limited in size to 1.000.000 events);

- With "ring" layout, changed display order of modules from clockwise to the
  more natural counter-clockwise.

- Extensive internal refactoring mostly because of the introduction exception
  handling and reorganization of inspector registration and creation.

Sample simulations:
- HCube, Token Ring and Dyna2 now use message subclassing. Token Ring has
  also been significantly revised. The PVMEx example has been removed.

- A new example simulation Topo has been created to demonstrate NED features.
  Currently it shows how to build various parametric topologies (chain, mesh,
  ring, star, random graph, binary tree, hexagonal grid) using NED.


OMNeT++ 2.2p1,p2,p3
-------------------
Only exist in source patch form.


In the OMNeT++ 2.2 release (May 2002)
-------------------------------------
It's almost a year since the last, 2.1 release, and that's why this change
list tends to be a bit lengthy. Sorry about that.

For this release I got many more bugfixes, bug reports and suggestions than
for any previous one. Thanks to everybody who helped! Huge credit goes to
Ulrich Kaage in Karlsruhe who built up a server infrastructure (CVS,
bugtracker, Wiki, etc.) and was restless in testing and improving OMNeT++.
Thanks Uli! This is the first release since the CVS went online last year.

This release contains experimental support for the long-demanded feature known
as 'message subclassing'. This means that C++ message classes can be generated
from NED code, replacing the practice of dynamically adding cPar objects to
messages. Data fields added via the subclassing mechanism are inspectable in
Tkenv. The new NED syntax is experimental; the compiler extensions have been
temporarily implemented in Perl. The new Dyna2 sample simulation demonstrates
this feature. See doc/msgsubclassing.txt for more information.

The simulation kernel now has an indexed and hyperlinked on-line API reference,
generated from header file comments. (We're using Doxygen.) At the same time,
the Reference chapter in the manual was deleted.

Distributed simulation can now use the MPI library which is more readily
available nowadays than PVM. (Code contributed by Eric Wu).

The simulation kernel was made const-correct; because of this, older code
may need changes (especially where one didn't use the Module_Class_Members()
macro to define module classes.) There were other changes on the simulation
kernel to make it cleaner.

cGate::setDisplayString() was fixed: changes are now immediately reflected
in the Tkenv graphics as they should. cModule's display string methods were
reorganized: the displayString(int type) method was split into displayString()
and displayStringAsParent(), eliminating the type parameter. Similar change
was made to the set...() methods. (Old methods remained but are now
deprecated.)  All setDisplayString() methods are now compatible with
auto-layouted modules (randomly placed modules won't jump around in Tkenv
after each display update).

New methods: opp_nextrand(long& seed); opp_strlen(..); opp_strprettytrunc(..);
opp_mkindexedname(..) (the latter was formerly called indexedname()).
fullName() no longer uses a static buffer; with fullPath(), it is possible
to avoid static buffers by using the new fullPath(buffer,buflen) method.

In NED, an expression may now refer to a submodule parameter with the following
syntax: submod.par or submod[index].par. A limitation is that the index
might not be an expression itself.

Foundations of a simulation kernel regression test suite have been laid
down. The test/ subdirectory contains a few initial test cases that rely
on the new opp_test tool. The test tool can be very well used to build
model tests, too. Also, as tests tend to be compact and easy to write, the
test tool is also excellent for experimenting with OMNeT++ library classes.
See doc/opp_test.txt for details.

The Envir library has been extended with a plugin mechanism: one can now
plug in code that actually handles recording output vectors (e.g. one can
write them to database instead of files, apply filtering before writing
them out, or send them to a simulation controller app) without having
to modify the user interface library, the simulation kernel or existing models.
Similar mechanisms exist for output scalars and snapshots. The new
include/envirext.h header contains the interfaces the plugins have to
conform to: cOutputVectorManager, cOutputScalarManager, cSnapshotManager.

Tkenv's plugin handling was improved: plugins are searched in the directories
in OMNETPP_PLUGIN_PATH (set to ./plugins by default). DLL file names that are
looked for now correctly depend on the platform (*.dll on windows, .so* on
Unix).

For the default output vector mechanism (vec files), number precision was
increased to 9 digits (fprintf format changed).

The module parameter change logging feature is no longer supported.

Size limitations on omnetpp.ini were removed (only max line length=1024 chars
remained).

ChangeLogs are now GNU-style, with the most recent entries at the top.

Exit codes of simulation programs were made more natural: 0 if the simulation
terminated normally, 1 otherwise. Also, SIGTERM and SIGINT signals are now
handled more gracefully: they call finish() before terminating the simulation
(Unix only).

In GNED, regexp find/replace now understands the \1,\2,... notation in replace
strings. Backwards search was implemented in the Find/Replace dialogs of GNED
and Tkenv. Fixed Plove's problems with tabs/spaces in vector files and
slashes/backslashes on Windows, and also GNED's problems with command-line
arguments.

The makefiles now use a new Perl-based dependency generator which works on all
platforms. opp_makemake: added -L option, and removed Makefile.in from the
'depend' target.


In the OMNeT++ 2.1 release (May 2001)
-------------------------------------
This release is devoted to making OMNeT++ easier to install, easier
to use and easier to learn. Most important, there is now a binary package
for Windows. The install package comes with Tcl/Tk, Gnuplot and some
Unix utilities (grep, awk) bundled, and in addition to the OMNeT++ programs
and libraries compiled with MSVC, it also contains prebuilt executables
of the sample simulations. To shorten the learning curve, the package
contains Nick van Foreest's Queueing Tutorial. Some MSVC integration stuff
(AppWizard, macro to add a NED file to the project) was also added.

Changes in the source distribution: it now includes the Tutorial and
the sources of the MSVC integration components. To facilitate creating
binary distributions, omnetpp.h and the other simulation kernel headers
have been moved out of src/sim/, to a new include/ directory. There was no
change on the simulation kernel itself.

Further enhancements: Plove can now be built as a single executable with
compiled-in Tcl code; on Windows, Plove and GNED can now be compiled as GUI
apps (using WinMain() instead of main()). I added makefiles for Win95/98/ME
(although I couldn't test them). Borland C++ is no longer supported:
I removed the old project files (*.ide), but added back (unsupported)
Makefile.bc's.


In the OMNeT++ 2.0 patch 1 (March 2001)
---------------------------------------
Fixes build issues with Cygwin, PVM, and static libs under Unix.


In the OMNeT++ 2.0 final version (February 2001)
------------------------------------------------
There are a number of enhancements mainly on the GUI parts, GNED and Tkenv,
but the simulation API remains fully compatible. Bugs that were reported
since the 2.0b5 release have largely been fixed. All those who cared to
report bugs and suggested features -- thanks!

In cQueue, a number of methods were made virtual to enable customizing the
class (e.g. adding statistics for maintaining average queue length, etc.).
Some bugfixes on cQueue, cArray and cBag. I also added the OMNETPP_VERSION
symbol to the sim header files (currently #defined as 0x0200).

Tkenv was enhanced quite a bit. Now you can now open module output windows for
all modules (not only for simple modules), and the window will accumulate
ev<< output from that module and all submodules. (This feature is especially
useful for tracing dynamically created modules). Now you can search for text
in all module windows (^F Find, F3/^N Find next). Hotkeys were assigned to the
run commands too (F4 Step, F5 Run, F6 Fast, F7 Express, F8 Stop), and the
behaviour of the "step within module" command (^F4) was refined. I added a
Performance status bar (it displays events/sec, simulated sec/sec,
events/simulated sec readings). Another toolbar shows (among others) the number
of message objects currently in existence -- this feature may help you discover
the most common kind of memory leaks: forgetting to delete messages.
Display string handling was improved: modules in a module vector may now be
positioned individually, and submodule display strings may use the parent
module's parameters, too. See src/tkenv/ChangeLog for details.

The most important addition to GNED is its new, experimental XML support (needs
the TclXML-1.2 package). XML will play a much more significant role in future
releases of OMNeT++, as a universal data exchange format. Many smaller
enhancements: GNED now accepts NED file names as command line arguments;
.gnedrc was introduced; more & better Properties dialogs (Channel, Connection,
Module, etc. Properties); GNED is more careful now when you want to exit the
program; the File menu now has a Save all item. Plus a number of other fixes
to improve the robustness and reliability of the code.

A short section was added to the manual about parallel simulation in general.


In the OMNeT++ 2.0 beta 5 version (June 2000)
---------------------------------------------
Fixed the errors/warnings that occurred when compiling 2.0b4 with gcc 2.95.2.


In the OMNeT++ 2.0 beta 4 version (May 2000)
--------------------------------------------
This is release is a preparation to the 2.0 final release: most of the changes
improve on the ISO compliance, cleanliness, portability or quality of the code
and fix bugs, but there are a number of new features too.

Steps toward better ISO compliance: the source was made 'const char *'-correct,
and the TRUE/FALSE #defines were replaced by the true/false C++ keywords.
Also, nearly all '-Wall' gcc warnings were eliminated from the source.

Now it is possible to create DLLs from the libraries on Windows. This wasn't
as easy as I thought, because there are fundamental conceptual differences
between Windows DLLs and Unix shared objects. (For me it seems like the Unix
approach is a lot more flexible.) The MSVC makefiles were further refined
using a contribution from Balazs Kelemen.

Improvements on the simulation library: Multi-stage module initialization
support via cModule's initialize(int stage) and int numInitStages() functions.
The send...() functions now have versions which take cGate* pointers.
sum() and sqrSum() members added to the statistics classes (cStdDev and
subclasses); isNumeric() member added to cPar; remove(cObject *) added to
cArray. Also, three functions were added to cModule to facilitate navigating
the module hierarchy: int findSubmodule(...), cModule *submodule(...) and
cModule *moduleByRelativePath(...).

New Cmdenv/Tkenv features: you may link more than one user interfaces into the
simulation executable, and you can select one at runtime with the
[General]/user-interface=Tkenv (or =Cmdenv) ini file option or the -u Tkenv
(or -u Cmdenv) command-line argument to the simulation executable.
The per-module extra stack size needed by the user interface libraries
can now be configured from the ini file: [Cmdenv]/extra-stack= and
[Tkenv]/extra-stack= options.

The setDisplayString() sim.library functions are now properly handled by Tkenv,
so you can change the network graphics at runtime. Module parameters in display
strings (e.g. in "p=$xpos,$ypos;i=router") are also implemented finally.
However, implementing the message appearance customization feature (message
display strings) was left for next releases.

In NEDC (and GNED), fixed the ?: operator and changed its precedence to bind
looser than || and &&. Changed nedc-generated code to suppress warnings about
unused variables (which are normal anyway in machine-generated code); this
could only be done for MSVC and Borland C++ because gcc seems to lack such a
pragma.

Unfortunately I didn't get a chance to further refine GNED. It would really
help to have contributors to GNED development, so if you're interested, please
write! (Basically only Tcl/Tk programming is required [no need to touch the
C++ part], and I could give any support needed.)

Makefiles change: the 'install-local' target was eliminated: the new-built
libraries and programs are immediately copied to the lib/ and bin/ subdirs.

Several other smaller changes like fixed PVM execution; improved error
handling, bugfix related to wrong transmissionFinishes() behavior, etc; see the
sim/ChangeLog file.


In the OMNeT++ 2.0 beta 3 version (Jan 2000)
--------------------------------------------
License change: you can now elect to use GPL for the whole OMNeT++ package.

Compiling with MSVC is now supported. Makefile.vc files have been added for
system components, and project files for sample simulatons. No DLL support yet.
MSVC support required a number or small changes in the sources too.

The documentation was significantly expanded and reorganized. RefMan got merged
into the User Manual, and the new User Manual now contains a lot of background
information, new hints and techniques, references to other simulation packages,
etc. New sections include in-depth analyis of handleMessage() and activity(),
and a comparison with Parsec.

GNED has been further enhanced: you can create submodules by dragging a module
type from the tree view to the canvas; submodule names can be edited in-place;
there are dialogs to edit submodule, connection, channel, etc. specifications
directly.

A new sample called Demo was added which works as a GUI shell to the other
sample simulations, and also demonstrates how you can link several simulation
models into a single executable. The other samples were cleaned up a bit too
(e.g. indentation & commenting made more consistent).

Some API changes were made to improve the clarity of the code. See API_CHANGES
in the doc/ directory.

TVEnv was removed from the distribution.


In the OMNeT++ 2.0 beta 1 and 2 versions (Sep,Nov 1999)
-------------------------------------------------------

License conditions have been alleviated: from this release on, one can elect
to use GPL for the base components of OMNeT++.

The configure script has been replaced by GNU Autoconf. The makefiles have been
brushed up (more standard symbol names, autodepend, version number in lib names,
etc). Cygwin is now fully supported. DOS+BC3.1 support has been removed for
lack of interest. File names longer than 8+3 are now used within the package.

Most of the effort since the last release was put into GNED. As a result,
GNED can now directly read/write NED files, so you can use it to work on your
existing NED sources. Moreover, GNED is now a fully two-way tool: you can edit
compound modules in graphic or in NED source form, and switch to the other view
any time. The GUI has been improved too: toolbar icons, tooltips, NED syntax
highlight. GNED is still in beta and there's some missing functionality.

Tkenv's user interface has also undergone some beautifying and bugfixing:
now it has toolbar icons, tooltips, etc.

OMNETPP_BITMAP_PATH can now contain a list of directories; it includes "." and
"./bitmaps" by default, so individual simulation models can have their own
icons in their own directories.

Smaller enhancements were made to the simulation library. Some of them are:
dynamic simple modules can now be created and booted in one step by using
cModuleType's createScheduleInit() function; callInitialize() and callFinish()
was added to the module classes (for compound modules they work recursively);
behavior of cancelEvent() slightly changed. cMessage now has isScheduled()
and isSelfMessage() member functions; a "context pointer" was also added to
cMessage to facilitate writing modules which use a large number of self
messages concurrently.

See the ChangeLog in the directory of the individual components for details
on what has been changed/fixed/improved.

Contributions have been added. They include NED syntax highlight for Emacs,
and recipes and sample code to use Octave with OMNeT++.

Which is less visible to you, the development has moved to use CVS.


In version of Feb, 1999 (OMNeT++ 1.1)
-------------------------------------

handleMessage() support added as alternative to activity(). Finite
State Machines (FSMs) are now also supported. They are demonstrated
in the fifo2 sample simulation.

The cPacket class and the protocol.h header was added; its aim is
to standardize on protocol models. Negative message kind values
are now reserved.

Added contributed howto about using OMNeT++ on NT with CYGWIN. Also
added contributed report on using message subclassing.

The way of writing custom inspectors has been redesigned to make it
more flexible. Also, Tkenv now has a plugin interface.

Several bugfixes and smaller improvements: Tkenv message inspector
redesigned; bugs in the ini file reader and the statistics classes
were fixed; vsscanf() was eliminated; the makefiles are now created
from makefile.in files; wait(), receive() and surroundings were
optimized; bug in GNED bug fixed etc.


In version of Aug, 1998 (OMNeT++ 1.0)
-------------------------------------

Data collection by output vectors can be configured in the ini file
(ie. OPNET 'probes'). Display strings can now be specified in the ini file
as an alternative to embedding them in ned files.

GNED has been totally rewritten. Now it supports colors, icon selection
etc. and correctly generates display strings. Cut/copy/paste capability.

A models/support library added with several base/utility classes and modules.

Ported to Windows 95/NT. Borland C++ 5.0 project files are included.

Numerous smaller improvements on Plove and Tkenv. Possibility
to make standalone simulation executables with Tkenv's TCL script
parts compiled into the executable.

To-do list and coding conventions (style guide) has been added to the
docs; please stick to it. Tkenv is now better documented; and so is the
cKSplit class.

As usually, additions and changes in the User Manual are marked with
(new) in the text. It does not necessarily mean the feature documented
there is new; most probably only the documentation is.

As usually, you're welcome to hack on the code and send in patches!
GNED is a very good target to start at. If you plan to do development,
you can sign up on the OMNeT++ mailing list and exchange ideas with
others.


In version of July, 1998
------------------------

Documentation now includes quickstart reference for OPNET users.
Additions to the User Manual are marked with (new!) in the text.

Tkenv has been improved significantly. Better animation: message names
are displayed and message kind is color-coded. New connection inspector
shows a connection path graphically. Module inspector has been redesigned
in notepad-style. Right-click popup menus in inspector windows.
Variables can be changed at run-time by cWatch inspectors. You can now
use the menu and play with the inspectors while simulation is running.
Several smaller improvements.

Routing support through the cTopology class. Other new classes are
cWeightedStdDev, cLinkedList. Direct message encapsulation support.
cPar can now store void* pointers. Output scalar file added which
accumulates results from several simulation runs. Several refinements
on the class library, more informative error messages.

Improved makemake script supports large models which span across
multiple directories. Plove made more intuitive with mc-like key bindings
and right-click popup menus.


In version of June 5, 1998
--------------------------

Documentation now comes also in HTML. We now have an LSM entry.

Tkenv made the default user interface.

Network graphics (module icons, connection arrows etc) and message
flow animation has been added to Tkenv. Usefulness of Tkenv dramatically
improved. Default graphics for models originally written without
graphics (no modifications needed).

By default, libraries are now dynamically linked which drastically reduces
executable sizes. You can revert to static linking by editing in `configure'.
You can load shared objects (e.g simple module code) at run-time
(-l command-line option).

Source directory tree changed to be more 'unix-like'.

New histogram class with user-defined and equal-frequency cells added
(thanks to Gabor Lencse), existing ones cleaned up and significantly
enhanced.

Wildcards (*,?) can be used in omnetpp.ini to supply values to several
model parameters at a time. Ini file inclusion and multiple ini files
support (via multiple -f command-line options) added. Total stack size
for the coroutines can now be given in the omnetpp.ini file.

Several bug fixes and minor improvements on Plove, GNED etc.


Version of May, 1998
--------------------
Wasn't publicly announced.


In version of March, 1998
-------------------------

An new interactive tool, Plove has been added. Plove is for analyzing
and plotting output vector files. Plove uses gnuplot to do the actual
work. In addition to viewing, you can save the gnuplot graphs to files
(postscript, latex, pbm etc) with a click. Filtering the results
before plotting (averaging, truncation, smoothing, etc) is possible.
Some filters are built in, and you can easily create new filters or
modify the existing ones.

Portability: Unix and (with some limitations) Win95/NT


In version of February, 1998
----------------------------

Type checking has been added to the NED language and the compiler.
New operators have also been added (like binary and/or/xor, shifting etc).

Now it is not necessary to declare module parameters and gates in .cc files
(Module..End stuff can be left out).

A new example program, HCube was added. It simulates an arbitrary-size
hypercube network with a simple deflection routing.

A configur script was added that -- on Unix platforms -- finds the
installation directories of Tcl/Tk, X, PVM and Turbo Vision, and
customizes the makefiles accordingly.

The Jar compiler has been renamed to NEDC because the name 'Jar' was
used by other software (a DOS archiver; Java tar on Solaris etc.)

Some scripts in util/ have also been renamed.

Now it is possible to specify values with time units (s,ms,us,m,h,d etc.)
in omnetpp.ini.

Misc improvements: some bugs fixed; some error messages in the sim. kernel
made more informative etc.


In version of December, 1997
----------------------------

A graphical model editor (GNED) is here. It's written entirely in Tcl/Tk.
Try it. It is the first, simple version; there's more to come.

The way of defining simple modules has been simplified a lot. Check out the
manual or see the example programs!

A new example program (fifo) was added that models a single-server queue and
also demonstrates how to derive a simple module from another one.

Important: the [All runs] ini file section has been renamed to [Parameters] to
reduce misunderstandings.


In version of October 15, 1997
------------------------------

Several member functions (and even classes) have been renamed for the sake
of a more readable code as well as consistency in naming and style. The utils
directory contains a Unix script (convert) to upgrade your files.

The cKSplit class was added -- another, experimental on-line distribution
approximation method.

Several bugfixes and improvements, updated manual.

The arg.list to the constructor of the histogram classes has changed --
beware, the compiler might not warn you!


In version of September 15, 1997
--------------------------------

Tkenv has been developed upon a lot -- try it with the improved Token Ring
example!

Parallel execution via PVM has been tested and significantly improved.
Syncpoints (a tool for synchronization) were added. See the user manual
for details. Go ahead and do Parallel Discrete Event Simulation (PDES)
with OMNeT++!

The implementation of the message queue (Future Event Set) has become more
efficient: the underlying data structure has been changed to heap.
