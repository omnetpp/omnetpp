# OMNeT++

OMNeT++ is a public-source, component-based, modular and open-architecture
simulation environment with strong GUI support and an embeddable simulation
kernel. Its primary application area is the simulation of communication
networks, but it has been successfully used in other areas like the simulation
of IT systems, queueing networks, hardware architectures and business processes
as well.

See the main OMNeT++ website [omnetpp.org](https://omnetpp.org) for documentation,
tutorials and other introductory materials, release downloads, model catalog,
and other useful information.
